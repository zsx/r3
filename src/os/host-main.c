**  Purpose:
**      Provides the outer environment that calls the REBOL lib.
**      This module is more or less just an example and includes
**      a very simple console prompt.

// response to a breakpoint--as is done here--continuation should be done
// purposefully vs. "accidentally resuming" just because a FAIL or a THROW
