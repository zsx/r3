// %host-main.c is the original entry point for the open-sourced R3-Alpha.
// Depending on whether it was POSIX or Windows, it would define either a
// `main()` or `WinMain()`, and implemented a very rudimentary console.
//
// On POSIX systems it uses <termios.h> to implement line editing:
//
// http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/termios.html
//
// On Windows it uses the Console API:

    // _WIN32_WINNT constant to 0x0501 specifies the minimum targeted version
    // is Windows XP.  This is the earliest platform API still supported by
    // Visual Studio 2015:
    //
    //     https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sehtctf.aspx
    //
    // R3-Alpha used 0x0500, indicating a minimum target of Windows 2000.  No
    // Windows-XP-specific dependencies were added in Ren-C, but the version
    // was bumped to avoid compilation errors in the common case.
