// This file contains `Do_Core()`, which is the central evaluator which
// is behind DO.  It can execute single evaluation steps (e.g. a DO/NEXT)
// or it can run the array to the end of its content.  A flag controls that
// behavior, and there are DO_FLAG_XXX for controlling other behaviors.
//
// For comprehensive notes on the input parameters, output parameters, and
// internal state variables...see %sys-rebfrm.h.
//
// NOTES:
//
// * Do_Core() is a very long routine.  That is largely on purpose, because it
//   doesn't contain repeated portions.  If it were broken into functions that
//   would add overhead for little benefit, and prevent interesting tricks
//   and optimizations.  Note that it is separated into sections, and
//   the invariants in each section are made clear with comments and asserts.
//
// * The evaluator only moves forward, and it consumes exactly one element
//   from the input at a time.  This input must be locked read-only for the
//   duration of the execution.  At the moment it can be an array tracked by
//   index and incrementation, or it may be a C va_list which tracks its own
//   position on each fetch through a forward-only iterator.
//

#if !defined(NDEBUG)
    //
    // The evaluator `tick` should be visible in the C debugger watchlist as a
    // local variable in Do_Core() for each stack level.  So if a fail()
    // happens at a deterministic moment in a run, capture the number from
    // the level of interest and recompile with it here to get a breakpoint
    // at that tick.
    //
    // Notice also that in debug builds, `REBSER.tick` carries this value.
    // *Plus* you can get the initialization tick for void cells, BLANK!s,
    // LOGIC!s, and most end markers by looking at the `track` payload of
    // the REBVAL cell.  And series contain the `REBSER.tick` where they were
    // created as well.
    //
    //      *** DON'T COMMIT THIS v-- KEEP IT AT ZERO! ***
    #define TICK_BREAKPOINT        0
    //      *** DON'T COMMIT THIS --^ KEEP IT AT ZERO! ***
    //
    // Note: Taking this number on the command line sounds convenient, though
    // with command line processing in usermode it would throw the number off
    // between runs.  It could be an environment variable, but sometimes it's
    // just easier to set the number here.
    //
    // Note also there is `Dump_Frame_Location()` if there's a trouble spot
    // and you want to see what the state is.  It will reify C va_list
    // input for you, so you can see what the C caller passed as an array.

// f->refine is a bit tricky.  If it IS_LOGIC() and TRUE, then this means that
// a refinement is active but revokable, having its arguments gathered.  So
// it actually points to the f->arg of the active refinement slot.  If
// evaluation of an argument in this state produces no value, the refinement
// must be revoked, and its value mutated to be FALSE.
//
// But all the other values that f->refine can hold are read-only pointers
// that signal something about the argument gathering state:
//
// * If NULL, then refinements are being skipped and the arguments
//   that follow should not be written to.
//
// * If BLANK_VALUE, this is an arg to a refinement that was not used in
//   the invocation.  No consumption should be performed, arguments should
//   be written as unset, and any non-unset specializations of arguments
//   should trigger an error.
//
// * If FALSE_VALUE, this is an arg to a refinement that was used in the
//   invocation but has been *revoked*.  It still consumes expressions
//   from the callsite for each remaining argument, but those expressions
//   must not evaluate to any value.
//
// * If EMPTY_BLOCK, it's an ordinary arg...and not a refinement.  It will
//   be evaluated normally but is not involved with revocation.
//
// * If EMPTY_STRING, the evaluator's next argument fulfillment is the
//   left-hand argument of a lookback operation.  After that fulfillment,
//   it will be transitioned to EMPTY_BLOCK.
//
// Because of how this lays out, IS_TRUTHY() can be used to determine if an
// argument should be type checked normally...while IS_FALSEY() means that the
// arg's bits must be set to void.  Since the skipping-refinement-args case
// doesn't write to arguments at all, it doesn't get to the point where the
// decision of type checking needs to be made...so using NULL for that means
// the comparison is a little bit faster.
//
// These special values are all pointers to read-only cells, but are cast to
// mutable in order to be held in the same pointer that might write to a
// refinement to revoke it.  Note that since literal pointers are used, tests
// like `f->refine == BLANK_VALUE` are faster than `IS_BLANK(f->refine)`.
