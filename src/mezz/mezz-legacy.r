    Description: {
        These definitions attempt to create a compatibility mode for Ren-C,
        so that it operates more like R3-Alpha.

        Some "legacy" definitions (like `foreach` as synonym of `for-each`)
        are enabled by default, and may remain indefinitely.  Other changes
        may be strictly incompatible: words have been used for different
        purposes, or variations in natives of the same name.  Hence it is
        necessary to "re-skin" the environment, by running:

            do <r3-legacy>

        (Dispatch for this from DO is in the DO* function of %sys-base.r)

        This statement will do nothing in older Rebols, since executing a
        tag evaluates to just a tag.

        Though as much of the compatibility bridge as possible is sought to
        be implemented in user code, some flags affect the executable behavior
        of the evaluator.  To avoid interfering with the native performance of
        Ren-C, THESE ARE ONLY ENABLED IN DEBUG BUILDS.  Be aware of that.

        Legacy mode is intended to assist in porting efforts to Ren-C, and to
        exercise the abilities of the language to "flex".  It is not intended
        as a "supported" operating mode.  Contributions making it work more
        seamlessly are welcome, but scheduling of improvements to the legacy
        mode are on a strictly "as-needed" basis.
    }
    Notes: {
        At present it is a one-way street.  Once `do <r3-legacy>` is run,
        there is no clean "shutdown" of legacy mode to go back to plain Ren-C.

        The current trick will modify the user context directly, and is not
        module-based...so you really are sort of "backdating" the system
        globally.  A more selective version that turns features on and off
        one at a time to ease porting is needed, perhaps like:

            do/args <r3-legacy> [
                new-do: off
                question-marks: on
            ]
    }
]

; This identifies if r3-legacy mode is has been turned on, useful mostly
; to avoid trying to turn it on twice.

; CONSTRUCT (arity 2) and HAS (arity 1) have arisen as the OBJECT!-making
; routines, parallel to FUNCTION (arity 2) and DOES (arity 1).  By not being
; nouns like CONTEXT and OBJECT, they free up those words for other usages.
; For legacy support, both CONTEXT and OBJECT are just defined to be HAS.
;
; Note: Historically OBJECT was essentially a synonym for CONTEXT with the
; ability to tolerate a spec of `[a:]` by transforming it to `[a: none].
; The tolerance of ending with a set-word has been added to CONSTRUCT+HAS
; so this distinction is no longer required.

; R3-Alpha's APPLY had a historically brittle way of handling refinements,
; based on their order in the function definition.  e.g. the following would
; be how to say saying `APPEND/ONLY/DUP A B 2`:
;
;     apply :append [a b none none true true 2]
;
; Ren-C's default APPLY construct is based on evaluating a block of code in
; the frame of a function before running it.  This allows refinements to be
; specified as TRUE or FALSE and the arguments to be assigned by name.  It
; also accepts a WORD! or PATH! as the function argument which it fetches,
; which helps it deliver a better error message labeling the applied function
; (instead of the stack frame appearing "anonymous"):

; to the names of parameters at the callsite.  One might not want to remember
; those, or perhaps just not want to fail if the names are changed.
;
; This implementation of R3-ALPHA-APPLY is a stopgap compatibility measure for
; the positional version.  It shows that such a construct could be written in
; userspace--even implementing the /ONLY refinement.  This is hoped to be a
; "design lab" for figuring out what a better positional apply might look like.
