    Description: {
        This code is evaluated just after actions, natives, sysobj, and
        other lower level definitions. This file intializes a minimal working
        environment that is used for the rest of the boot.
    }
    Note: {
        Any exported SET-WORD!s must be themselves "top level". This hampers
        procedural code here that would like to use tables to avoid repeating
        itself.  This means variadic approaches have to be used that quote
        SET-WORD!s living at the top level, inline after the function call.

; Because it has `return: []`, a comment is effectively "invisible".  Internal

; Despite being very "noun-like", HEAD and TAIL have classically been "verbs"

; ultimate effect.
