    Purpose: {
        These words define the REBOL datatypes and their related attributes.
        This table generates a variety of C defines and intialization tables.
        During build, when this file is processed, this section is changed to
        hold just the datatype words - the initial entries the word table.

        name        - name of datatype (generates words)
        class       - how type actions are dispatched (T_type), + is extension
        path        - it supports various path forms (* for same as typeclass)
        make        - It can be made with #[datatype] method
        typesets    - what typesets the type belongs to

        Note that if there is `somename` in the class column, that means you
        will find the ACTION! dispatch for that type in `REBTYPE(Somename)`.

        If the (CLASS) is in a GROUP! that means it has evaluator behavior,
        vs. being passed through as-is.  (e.g. a lit-word is "evaluative")
        This is used to build the table used for fast lookup of whether the
        evaluator needs to be called on a given type.
