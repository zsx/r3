    Purpose: {
        This section holds lower-level C strings used in various parts
        of the system. This section is unique, because it constructs a
        single C string that contains all the specified strings below.
        This is done to eliminate series headers required for normal
        REBOL strings. The strings are referenced using Boot_Strs[RS_*]
        where * is the set-word (and is zero based). For example:
        RS_SCAN+3 refers to "end-of-paren"
    }
