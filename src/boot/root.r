    Purpose: {
        Root system values. This context is hand-made very early at boot time
        to allow it to hold key system values during boot up. Most of these
        are put here to prevent them from being garbage collected.

errobj          ; error object template
strings         ; low-level strings accessed via Boot_Strs[] (GC protection)

;; Tags used in the native-optimized versions of user-function-generators
;; FUNC and PROC

no-return-tag   ; func w/o definitional return, ignores non-definitional ones
infix-tag       ; func is treated as "infix" (first parameter comes before it)
local-tag       ; marks the beginning of a list of "pure locals"
durable-tag     ; !!! In progress - argument word lookup survives call ending

;; Natives can usually be identified by their code pointers and addresses
;; (e.g. `VAL_FUNC_CODE(native) == &N_parse`) and know their own values via
;; D_FUNC when running.  However, RETURN is special because its code pointer
;; is overwritten so it must be recognized by its paramlist series.
;;
;; (PARSE just wants access to its D_FUNC more convenient from a nested call)

;; PRINT takes a /DELIMIT which can be a block specifying delimiters at each
;; level of depth in the recursion of blocks.  The default is [#" " |], which
;; is a signal to put spaces at the first level and then after that nothing.

;; The BREAKPOINT instruction needs to be able to re-transmit a RESUME
;; instruction in the case that it wants to leapfrog another breakpoint
;; sandbox on the stack, and needs access to the resume native for the label
;; of the retransmitted throw.  It also might need to generate a QUIT
;; throw if the breakpoint hook signaled it.

;; The FUNC and PROC function generators are native code, and quick access
;; to a block of [RETURN:] or [LEAVE:] is useful to share across all of the
;; instances of functions like those created by DOES.  Having a filled
;; REBVAL of the word alone saves a call to Val_Init_Word_Unbound with
;; the symbol as well.
