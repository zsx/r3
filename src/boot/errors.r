Internal: [
    ; Some of these internal errors can happen prior to when the error
    ; catalog (e.g. the blocks in this file) have been loaded as Rebol data.
    ; Those strings need to be accessible another way, so %make-boot.r takes
    ; the string data and duplicates it as C literals usable by Panic_Core()
    ;
    ; Note: Because these are flattened into printf-style format strings
    ; instead of using the ordinary error-building mechanism, argument
    ; ordering is not honored when an error is raised using the mechanism
    ; from before when booting is ready.  It's also probably a bad idea to
    ; use sophisticated REBVALs as arguments, because it may be too early
    ; in the boot process for them to be molded properly.
    ;
    code: 100
    type: "internal"

    ; Because adding an error code has the overhead of modifying this file and
    ; coming up with a good name, errors for testing or that you don't think
    ; will happen can be put here.  A debug build will identify the line
    ; number and file source of the error, so provides some info already.
