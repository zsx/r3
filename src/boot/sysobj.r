        such that its words do not get put into the current context.

; !!! HAS is defined later, so this uses CONSTRUCT [] [body] instead.
; MAKE OBJECT! is not used because that is too low-level (no evaluation or
; collection of fields).  Reconsider if base-funcs should be loaded before
; the system object here, or if it should be able to work with just the
; low level MAKE OBJECT! and not use things like `x: y: z: none` etc.
