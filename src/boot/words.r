        These words are used internally by REBOL and must have specific canon
        word values in order to be correctly identified.

any-value! ;-- signal typesets start (SYM_ANY_VALUE_X hardcoded reference)
any-word!
any-path!
any-number!
any-scalar!
any-series!
any-string!
any-context!
any-array! ;-- replacement for ANY-BLOCK! that doesn't conflate with BLOCK!

;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Signal that every earlier numbered symbol is for a typeset or datatype...

datatypes

; ...note that the words for types are created programmatically before
; this list is applied, so you only see typesets in this file.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; !!! Kept for functionality of #[none] in the loader for <r3-legacy>
none

; For the moment, TO-WORD of a datatype is willing to canonize a datatype
; as a word.  Long term, that specialization is not desirable because it
; is effectively building keywords deep into the system.  Better would be
; if datatypes could be communicated e.g. by #[()] for "groups" or "parens".
;
; Hardcoding in the GROUP! symbol is necessary for a legacy switch to be
; willing to convert a "group!" into the word GROUP!
;
paren!

; The PICK* action was killed in favor of a native that uses the same logic
; as path processing.  Code still remains for processing PICK*, and ports or
; other mechanics may wind up using it...or path dispatch itself may be
; rewritten to use the PICK* action (but that would require significiant
; change for setting and getting paths)
;
; Similar story for POKE, which uses the same logic as PICK* to find the
; location to write the value.
