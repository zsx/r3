// Rebol is settled upon a stable and pervasive implementation baseline of
// ANSI-C (C89).  That commitment provides certain advantages.
//
// One of the *disadvantages* is that there is no safe way to do non-local
// jumps with stack unwinding (as in C++).  If you've written some code that
// performs a raw malloc and then wants to "throw" via a `longjmp()`, that
// will leak the malloc.
//
// In order to mitigate the inherent failure of trying to emulate stack
// unwinding via longjmp, the macros in this file provide an abstraction
// layer.  These allow Rebol to clean up after itself for some kinds of
// "dangling" state--such as manually memory managed series that have been
// made with Make_Series() but never passed to either Free_Series() or
// MANAGE_SERIES().  This covers several potential leaks known-to-Rebol,
// but custom interception code is needed for any generalized resource
// that might be leaked in the case of a longjmp().
//
// The triggering of the longjmp() is done via "fail", and it's important
// to know the distinction between a "fail" and a "throw".  In Rebol
// terminology, a `throw` is a cooperative concept, which does *not* use
// longjmp(), and instead must cleanly pipe the thrown value up through
// the OUT pointer that each function call writes into.  The `throw` will
// climb the stack until somewhere in the backtrace, one of the calls
// chooses to intercept the thrown value instead of pass it on.
//
// By contrast, a `fail` is non-local control that interrupts the stack,
// and can only be intercepted by points up the stack that have explicitly
// registered themselves interested.  So comparing these two bits of code:
//
//     catch [if 1 < 2 [trap [print ["Foo" (throw "Throwing")]]]]
//
//     trap [if 1 < 2 [catch [print ["Foo" (fail "Failing")]]]]
//
// In the first case, the THROW is offered to each point up the chain as
// a special sort of "return value" that only natives can examine.  The
// `print` will get a chance, the `trap` will get a chance, the `if` will
// get a chance...but only CATCH will take the opportunity.
//
// In the second case, the FAIL is implemented with longjmp().  So it
// doesn't make a return value...it never reaches the return.  It offers an
// ERROR! up the stack to native functions that have called PUSH_TRAP() in
// advance--as a way of registering interest in intercepting failures.  For
// IF or CATCH or PRINT to have an opportunity, they would need to be changed
// to include a PUSH_TRAP() call.
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// NOTE: If you are integrating with C++ and a longjmp crosses a constructed
// object, abandon all hope...UNLESS you use Ren-cpp.  It is careful to
// avoid this trap, and you don't want to redo that work.

// "Under FreeBSD 5.2.1 and Mac OS X 10.3, setjmp and longjmp save and restore
// the signal mask. Linux 2.4.22 and Solaris 9, however, do not do this.
// FreeBSD and Mac OS X provide the functions _setjmp and _longjmp, which do
// not save and restore the signal mask."
//
// "To allow either form of behavior, POSIX.1 does not specify the effect of
// setjmp and longjmp on signal masks. Instead, two new functions, sigsetjmp
// and siglongjmp, are defined by POSIX.1. These two functions should always
// be used when branching from a signal handler."
//
// Note: longjmp is able to pass a value (though only an integer on 64-bit
// platforms, and not enough to pass a pointer).  This can be used to
// dictate the value setjmp returns in the longjmp case, though the code
// does not currently use that feature.
//
// Also note: with compiler warnings on, it can tell us when values are set
// before the setjmp and then changed before a potential longjmp:
//

//
// Because of this longjmp/setjmp "clobbering", it's a useful warning to
// have enabled in.  One option for suppressing it would be to mark
// a parameter as 'volatile', but that is implementation-defined.
// It is best to use a new variable if you encounter such a warning.

// PUSH_TRAP is a construct which is used to catch errors that have been
// triggered by the Fail_Core() function.  This can be triggered by a usage
// of the `fail` pseudo-"keyword" in C code, and in Rebol user code by the
// REBNATIVE(fail).  To call the push, you need a `struct Reb_State` to be
// passed which it will write into--which is a black box that clients
// shouldn't inspect.
//
// The routine also takes a pointer-to-a-REBCTX-pointer which represents
// an error.  Using the tricky mechanisms of setjmp/longjmp, there will
// be a first pass of execution where the line of code after the PUSH_TRAP
// will see the error pointer as being NULL.  If a trap occurs during
// code before the paired DROP_TRAP happens, then the C state will be
// magically teleported back to the line after the PUSH_TRAP with the
// error value now non-null and usable, including put into a REBVAL via
// the `Init_Error()` function.

// PUSH_UNHALTABLE_TRAP is a form of PUSH_TRAP that will receive RE_HALT in
// the same way it would be told about other errors.  In a pure C client,
// it would usually be only at the topmost level (e.g. console REPL loop).
//
// It's also necessary at C-to-C++ boundary crossings (as in Ren/C++) even
// if they are not the topmost.  This is because C++ needs to know if *any*
// longjmp happens, to keep it from crossing stack frames with constructed
// objects without running their destructors.  Once it is done unwinding
// any relevant C++ call frames, it may have to trigger another longjmp IF
// the C++ code was called from other Rebol C code.  (This is done in the
// exception handler found in Ren/C++'s %function.hpp)
//
// Note: Despite the technical needs of low-level clients, there is likely
// no reasonable use-case for a user-exposed ability to intercept HALTs in
// Rebol code, for instance with a "TRAP/HALT" construction.

// Note: The implementation of this macro was chosen stylistically to

//
// Panics are the equivalent of the "blue screen of death" and should never
// happen in normal operation.  Generally, it is assumed nothing under the
// user's control could fix or work around the issue, hence the main goal is
// to provide the most diagnostic information possible.
//
// So the best thing to do is to pass in whatever REBVAL* or REBSER* subclass
// (including REBARR*, REBCTX*, REBFUN*...) is the most useful "smoking gun":
//
//     if (VAL_TYPE(value) == REB_VOID)
//         panic (value);
//
//     if (ARR_LEN(array) < 2)
//         panic (array);
//
// Both the debug and release builds will spit out diagnostics of the item,
// along with the file and line number of the problem.  The diagnostics are
// written in such a way that they give the "more likely to succeed" output
// first, and then get more aggressive to the point of possibly crashing by
// dereferencing corrupt memory which triggered the panic.  The debug build
// diagnostics will be more exhaustive, but the release build gives some info.
//
// The most useful argument to panic is going to be a problematic value or
// series vs. a message (especially given that the file and line number are
// included in the report).  But if no relevant smoking gun is available, a
// UTF-8 string can also be passed to panic...and it will terminate with that
// as a message:
//
//     if (sizeof(foo) != 42) {
//         panic ("invalid foo size");
//
//         /* this line will never be reached, because it
//            immediately exited the process with a message */

// more "keyword-like" and draw attention to the fact it is a `noreturn` call.
