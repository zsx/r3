//  Summary: Definitions for "Data Stack", "Chunk Stack" and the C stack
//  File: %sys-stack.h
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The data stack and chunk stack are two different data structures which
// are optimized for temporarily storing REBVALs and protecting them from
// garbage collection.  With the data stack, values are pushed one at a
// time...while with the chunk stack, an array of value cells of a given
// length is returned.
//
// A key difference between the two stacks is pointer stability.  Though the
// data stack can accept any number of pushes and then pop the last N pushes
// into a series, each push could potentially change the memory address of
// every value in the stack.  This is because the data stack uses a REBARR
// series as its implementation.  The chunk stack guarantees that the address
// of the values in a chunk will stay stable over the course of its lifetime.
//
// Because of their differences, they are applied to different problems:
//
// A notable usage of the data stack is by REDUCE and COMPOSE.  They use it
// as a buffer for values that are being gathered to be inserted into the
// final array.  It's better to use the data stack as a buffer because it
// means the precise size of the result can be known before either creating
// a new series or inserting /INTO a target.  This prevents wasting space on
// expansions or resizes and shuffling due to a guessed size.
//
// The chunk stack has an important use as the storage for arguments to
// functions being invoked.  The pointers to these arguments are passed by
// natives through the stack to other routines, which may take arbitrarily
// long to return...and may call code involving many pushes and pops.  These
// pointers must be stable, so using the data stack would not work.
//


//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  DATA STACK
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The data stack (DS_) is for pushing one individual REBVAL at a time.  The
// values can then be popped in a Last-In-First-Out way.  It is also possible
// to mark a stack position, do any number of pushes, and then ask for the
// range of values pushed since the mark to be placed into a REBARR array.
// As long as a value is on the data stack, any series it refers to will be
// protected from being garbage-collected.
//
// The data stack has many applications, and can be used by any piece of the
// system.  But there is a rule that when that piece is finished, it must
// "balance" the stack back to where it was when it was called!  There is
// a check in the main evaluator loop that the stack has been balanced to
// wherever it started by the time a function call ends.  However, it is not
// necessary to balance the stack in the case of calling a `fail`--because
// it will be automatically restored to where it was at the PUSH_TRAP().
//
// At the moment, the data stack is *mostly* implemented as a typical series.
// When Rebol was first open-sourced, there were some deviations from being
// a normal series.  It was not terminated with an END, so you would be
// required to call a special DS_TERMINATE() routine to put the terminator
// in place before using the data stack with a routine that expected
// termination.  It also had to be expanded manually, so a DS_PUSH was not
// guaranteed to trigger a potential growth of the stack..  If expansion
// hadn't been anticipated with a large enough space for that push (an
// arbitrary 20 slots was chosen per function call, for instance) it would
// corrupt memory.
//
// Overall, optimizing the stack structure should be easier now that it has
// a more dedicated purpose.  So those tricks are not being used *for the
// moment*.  Future profiling can try those and other approaches when a stable
// and complete system has been achieved.

//
//  CHUNK STACK
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Like the data stack, the values living in the chunk stack are protected
// from garbage collection.
//
// Unlike the data stack, the chunk stack allows for the pushing and popping
// of arbitrary-sized arrays of values which will not be relocated during
// their lifetime.
//
// This is accomplished using a custom "chunked" allocator.  The two structs
// involved are a list of "Chunkers", which internally have a list of
// "Chunks" threaded between them.  The method keeps one spare chunker
// allocated, and only frees a chunker when a full chunker prior has the last
// element popped out of it.  In memory it looks like this:
//
//      [chunker->next
//          (->payload_left size [value1][value2][value3]...)   // chunk 1
//          (->payload_left size [value1]...)                   // chunk 2
//          (->payload_left size [value1][value2]...)           // chunk 3
//          ...remaining payload space in chunker...
//      ]
//
// Since the chunker size is a known constant, it's possible to quickly deduce
// the chunker a chunk lives in from its pointer and the remaining payload
// amount in the chunker.

    // field a REBUPT (unsigned integer size of a pointer).  We are relying
    // on the fact that the low 2 bits of this value is always 0 in order
    // for it to be an implicit END for the value array of the previous chunk.
    //
    // (REBVALs are multiples of 4 bytes in size on all platforms Rebol

    // REBVAL termination.
    //
    // However it would be easy enough to get the 3 by masking the REBUPT's
    // high and low portions on 64-bit, and using a separate REBCNT field
    // on 32-bit.  This would complicate the code for now, and a previous

//  C STACK
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Rebol doesn't want to crash in the event of a stack overflow, but would
// like to gracefully trap it and return the user to the console.  While it
// is possible for Rebol to set a limit to how deeply it allows function
// calls in the interpreter to recurse, there's no *portable* way to
// catch a stack overflow in the C code of the interpreter itself.
//
// Hence, by default Rebol will use a non-standard heuristic.  It looks
// at the compiled addresses of local (stack-allocated) variables in a
// function, and decides from their relative pointers if memory is growing
// "up" or "down".  It then extrapolates that C function call frames will
// be laid out consecutively, and the memory difference between a stack
// variable in the topmost stacks can be checked against some limit.
//
// This has nothing to do with guarantees in the C standard, and compilers
// can really put variables at any address they feel like:
//
//     http://stackoverflow.com/a/1677482/211160
//
// Additionally, it puts the burden on every recursive or deeply nested
// routine to sprinkle calls to the C_STACK_OVERFLOWING macro somewhere
// in it.  The ideal answer is to make Rebol itself corral an interpreted
// script such that it can't cause the C code to stack overflow.  Lacking
// that ideal this technique could break, so build configurations should
// be able to turn it off if needed.
//
// In the meantime, C_STACK_OVERFLOWING is a macro which takes the
// address of some variable local to the currently executed function.
// Note that because the limit is noticed before the C stack has *actually*
// overflowed, you still have a bit of stack room to do the cleanup and
// raise an error trap.  (You need to take care of any unmanaged series
// allocations, etc).  So cleaning up that state should be doable without
// making deep function calls.
//
// !!! Future approaches should look into use of Windows stack exceptions
// or libsigsegv:
