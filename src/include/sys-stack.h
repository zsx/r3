**
**  Summary: REBOL Stack Definitions
**  Module:  sys-stack.h
**  Notes:
**
**  This contains the implementations of two important stacks in
**  the evaluator: the Data Stack and the Call Stack
**
**  DATA STACK (CS_*):
**
**  The data stack is mostly for REDUCE and COMPOSE, which use it
**  as a common buffer for values that are being gathered to be
**  inserted into another series.  It's better to go through this
**  buffer step because it means the precise size of the new
**  insertions are known ahead of time.  If a series is created,
**  it will not waste space or time on expansion, and if a series
**  is to be inserted into as a target, the proper size gap for
**  the insertion can be opened up exactly once (without any
**  need for repeatedly shuffling on individual insertions).
**
**  Beyond that purpose, the data stack can also be used as a
**  place to store a value to protect it from the garbage
**  collector.  The stack must be balanced in the case of success
**  when a native or action runs.  But if `raise` is used to trigger
**  an error, then the stack will be automatically balanced in
**  the trap handling.
**
**  The data stack specifically needs contiguous memory for its
**  applications.  That is more important than having stability
**  of pointers to any data on the stack.  Hence if any push or
**  pops can happen, there is no guarantee that the pointers will
**  remain consistent...as the memory buffer may need to be
**  reallocated (and hence relocated).  The index positions will
**  remain consistent, however: and using DSP and DS_AT it is
**  possible to work with stack items by index.
**
**  CALL STACK (CS_*):
**
**  The requirements for the call stack are different from the data
**  stack, due to a need for pointer stability.  Being an ordinary
**  series, the data stack will relocate its memory on expansion.
**  This creates problems for natives and actions where pointers to
**  parameters are saved to variables from D_ARG(N) macros.  These
**  would need a refresh after every potential expanding operation.
**
**  Having a separate data structure offers other opportunities,
**  such as hybridizing with CLOSURE! argument objects such that
**  they would not need to be copied from the data stack.  It also
**  allows freeing the information tracked by calls from the rule
**  of being strictly a sequence of REBVALs.
**
***********************************************************************/


/***********************************************************************
**
**  At the moment, the data stack is *mostly* implemented as a typical
**  series.  Pushing unfilled slots on the stack (via PUSH_TRASH_UNSAFE)
**  partially inlines Alloc_Tail_List, so it only pays for the function
**  call in cases where expansion is necessary.
**
**  When Rebol was first open-sourced, there were other deviations from
**  being a normal series.  It was not terminated with a REB_END, so
**  you would be required to call a special DS_TERMINATE() routine to
**  put the terminator in place before using the data stack with a
**  routine that expected termination.  It also had to be expanded
**  manually, so a DS_PUSH was not guaranteed to trigger a potential
**  growth of the stack--if expansion hadn't been anticipated with a
**  large enough space for that push, it would corrupt memory.
**
**  Overall, optimizing the stack structure should be easier now that
**  it has a more dedicated purpose.  So those tricks are not being
**  used for the moment.  Future profiling can try those and other
**  approaches when a stable and complete system has been achieved.

/***********************************************************************
**
**  The call stack uses a custom "chunked" allocator to avoid the
**  overhead of calling Make_Mem on each push and Free_Mem on
**  each pop.  It keeps one spare chunk allocated, and only frees
**  a chunk when a full chunk prior to it has the last element
**  popped out of it.  In memory the situation looks like this:
**
**      [chunk->next
**          (->chunk_left call->prior ...data [arg1][arg2][arg3]...)
**          (->chunk_left call->prior ...data [arg1]...)
**          (->chunk_left call->prior ...data [arg1][arg2]...)
**          ...chunk remaining space...
**      ]
**
**  Each [chunk] contains (calls).  The calls are singly linked
**  backwards to form the call frame stack, while the chunks are
**  singly linked forward.  Since the chunk size is a known
**  constant, it's possible to quickly deduce the chunk a call
**  lives in from its pointer and the remaining size in the chunk.
