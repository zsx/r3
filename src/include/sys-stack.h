**
**	Stack frame format:
**
**		   +---------------+
**	DSF->0:| Return Value  | normally becomes TOS after func return
**		   +---------------+
**		 1:|  Prior Frame  | old DSF, block, and block index
**		   +---------------+
**		 2:|   Func Word   | for backtrace info
**		   +---------------+
**		 3:|   Func Value  | in case value is moved or modified
**		   +---------------+
**		 4:|     Arg 1     | args begin here

**
**	REBOL DATA STACK (DS)
**
**		The data stack is mostly for REDUCE and COMPOSE, which use it
**		as a common buffer for values that are being gathered to be
**		inserted into another series.  It's better to go through this
**		buffer step because it means the precise size of the new
**		insertions are known ahead of time.  If a series is created,
**		it will not waste space or time on expansion, and if a series
**		is to be inserted into as a target, the proper size gap for
**		the insertion can be opened up exactly once (without any
**		need for repeatedly shuffling on individual insertions).
**
**		Beyond that purpose, the data stack can also be used as a
**		place to store a value to protect it from the garbage
**		collector.  The stack must be balanced in the case of success
**		when a native or action runs, but if a Trap() is called then
**		the stack will be automatically balanced.
**
**		The data stack specifically needs contiguous memory for its
**		applications.  That is more important than having stability
**		of pointers to any data on the stack.  Hence if any push or
**		pops can happen, there is no guarantee that the pointers will
**		remain consistent...as the memory buffer may need to be
**		reallocated (and hence relocated).  The index positions will
**		remain consistent, however: and using DSP and DS_AT it is
**		possible to work with stack items by index.

/***********************************************************************
**
**	REBOL CALL STACK (CS)
**
**		The requirements for the call stack are different from the data
**		stack, due to a need for pointer stability.  Being an ordinary
**		series, the data stack will relocate its memory on expansion.
**		This creates problems for natives and actions where pointers to
**		parameters are saved to variables from D_ARG(N) macros.  These
**		would need a refresh after every potential expanding operation.
**
**		Having a separate data structure offers other opportunities,
**		such as hybridizing with CLOSURE! argument objects such that
**		they would not need to be copied from the data stack.  It also
**		allows freeing the information tracked by calls from the rule
**		of being strictly a sequence of REBVALs.
