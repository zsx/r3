//  Summary: Evaluator "Do State" and Helpers
//  File: %sys-do.h
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The primary routine that performs DO and DO/NEXT is called Do_Core().  It
// takes a single parameter which holds the running state of the evaluator.
// This state may be allocated on the C variable stack:  Do_Core() is
// written such that a longjmp up to a failure handler above it can run
// safely and clean up even though intermediate stacks have vanished.
//
// Ren-C can not only run the evaluator across a REBSER-style series of
// input based on index, it can also fetch those values from a standard C
// array of REBVAL[].  Alternately, it can enumerate through C's `va_list`,
// providing the ability to pass pointers as REBVAL* to comma-separated input
// at the source level.
//
// To provide even greater flexibility, it allows the very first element's
// pointer in an evaluation to come from an arbitrary source.  It doesn't
// have to be resident in the same sequence from which ensuing values are
// pulled, allowing a free head value (such as a FUNCTION! REBVAL in a local
// C variable) to be evaluated in combination from another source (like a
// va_list or series representing the arguments.)  This avoids the cost and
// complexity of allocating a series to combine the values together.
//
// These features alone would not cover the case when REBVAL pointers that
// are originating with C source were intended to be supplied to a function
// with no evaluation.  In R3-Alpha, the only way in an evaluative context
// to suppress such evaluations would be by adding elements (such as QUOTE).
// Besides the cost and labor of inserting these, the risk is that the
// intended functions to be called without evaluation, if they quoted
// arguments would then receive the QUOTE instead of the arguments.
//
// The problem was solved by adding a feature to the evaluator which was
// also opened up as a new privileged native called EVAL.  EVAL's refinements
// completely encompass evaluation possibilities in R3-Alpha, but it was also
// necessary to consider cases where a value was intended to be provided
// *without* evaluation.  This introduced EVAL/ONLY.
//


//
// DO_FLAGS
//
// Used by low level routines, these flags specify behaviors which are
// exposed at a higher level through EVAL, EVAL/ONLY, and EVAL/NOFIX
//
// The flags are specified either way for clarity.
//
enum {
    DO_FLAG_0 = 0, // unused

    // As exposed by the DO native and its /NEXT refinement, a call to the
    // evaluator can either run to the finish from a position in an array
    // or just do one eval.  Rather than achieve execution to the end by
    // iterative function calls to the /NEXT variant (as in R3-Alpha), Ren-C
    // offers a controlling flag to do it from within the core evaluator
    // as a loop.
    //
    // However: since running to the end follows a different code path than
    // performing DO/NEXT several times, it is important to ensure they
    // achieve equivalent results.  There are nuances to preserve this
    // invariant and especially in light of potential interaction with
    // DO_FLAG_LOOKAHEAD.
    //
    // NOTE: DO_FLAG_NEXT is *non-continuable* with varargs.  This is due to
    // contention with DO_FLAG_LOOKAHEAD which would not be able to "un-fetch"
    // in the case of a lookahead for infix that failed (and NO_LOOKAHEAD is
    // very rare with API clients).  But also, the va_list could need a
    // conversion to an array during evaluation...and any continuation would
    // need to be sensitive to this change, which is extra trouble for very
    // little likely benefit.

    // arguments.  (e.g. with `1 + 2 * 3` we don't want infix `+` to
    // "look ahead" past the 2 to see the infix `*`)
    //
    // Actions taken during lookahead may have no side effects.  If it's used
    // to evaluate a form of source input that cannot be backtracked (e.g.
    // a C variable argument list) then it will not be possible to resume.

//
//      The THROWN_FLAG means your value does not represent a directly

//      rest of the system.

// ===========================================================================
//
// Note that THROWN() is not an indicator of an error, rather something that
// ordinary language constructs might meaningfully want to process as they
// bubble up the stack.  Some examples would be BREAK, RETURN, and QUIT.
//
// Errors are handled with a different mechanism using longjmp().  So if an

// Because access to a `va_list` is strictly increasing through va_arg(),
// there is no way to track an index; fetches are indexed automatically

// this index be used it will always be the index of a DO_NEXT until either

//
//  DO's "FRAMELESS" API => *LOWEST* LEVEL EVALUATOR HOOKING
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This API is used internally in the implementation of Do_Core.  It does
// not speak in terms of arrays or indices, it works entirely by setting
// up a call frame (c), and threading that frame's state through successive
// operations, vs. setting it up and disposing it on each DO/NEXT step.
//
// Like higher level APIs that move through the input series, the frameless
// API can move at full DO/NEXT intervals.  Unlike the higher APIs, the
// possibility exists to move by single elements at a time--regardless of
// if the default evaluation rules would consume larger expressions.  Also
// making it different is the ability to resume after a DO/NEXT on value
// sources that aren't random access (such as C's va_arg list).
//
// One invariant of access is that the input may only advance.  Before any
// operations are called, any low-level client must have already seeded
// c->value with a valid "fetched" REBVAL*.  END is not valid, so callers
// beginning a Do_To_End must pre-check that condition themselves before
// calling Do_Core.  And if an operation sets the c->index to END_FLAG then
// that must be checked--it's not legal to call more operations on a call
// frame after a fetch reports the end.
//
// Operations are:
//
//  FETCH_NEXT_ONLY_MAYBE_END
//
//      Retrieve next pointer for examination to c->value.  The previous
//      c->value pointer is overwritten.  (No REBVAL bits are moved by
//      this operation, only the 'currently processing' pointer reassigned.)
//      c->index may be set to END_FLAG if the end of input is reached.
//
// DO_NEXT_REFETCH_MAY_THROW
//
//      Executes the already-fetched pointer, consuming as much of the input
//      as necessary to complete a /NEXT (or failing with an error).  This
//      writes the computed REBVAL into a destination location.  After the
//      operation, the next c->value pointer will already be fetched and
//      waiting for examination or use.  c->index may be set to either
//      THROWN_FLAG or END_FLAG by this operation.
//
// DO_NEXT_REFETCH_QUOTED
//
//      This operation is fairly trivial in the sense that it just assigns
//      the REBVAL bits pointed to by the current value to the destination
//      cell.  Then it does a simple fetch.  The main reason for making an
//      operation vs just having callers do the two steps is to monitor
//      when some of the input has been "consumed" vs. merely fetched.
//
//      !!! This is unenforceable in the C build, but in the C++ build it
//      could be ensured c->value was only dereferenced via * and stored
//      to targets through this routine.
//
// This is not intending to be a "published" API of Rebol/Ren-C.  But the
// privileged level of access can be used by natives that feel they can
// optimize performance by working with the evaluator directly.  Code written
// in a frameless native can be essentially equally as fast as writing code
// inside of the main `switch()` statement of Do_Core(), as they hook out
// quickly once a function is identified.
//
// (So for instance, the implementation of `QUOTE` does not require setting
// up memory on the stack, enumerating parameters and checking parameter
// counts, checking to see the parameter is quoted and doing a quote refetch
// into that slot...then dispatching the function, checking that value,
// moving it to the output, freeing the stack memory.  `QUOTE` can just
// make sure it's not the end of the input, then call DO_NEXT_REFETCH_QUOTED
// itself and be done.)
//
// !!! If a native works at the frameless API level, that foregoes automatic
// parameter checking, and the absence of a call frame for debugging or
// tracing insight.  Hence each frameless native must still be able to run
// in a "framed" mode if necessary.  Error reporting has some help to say
// whether the error came from what would correspond to parameter fulfillment
// vs. execution were it an ordinary native.
//
// !!! For better or worse, Do_Core does not lock the series it is iterating.
// This means any arbitrary user code (or system code) could theoretically
// disrupt a series out from under it, and then crash the system on the
// next fetch.  Hence an array and an index are used, and in terms of "crash
// avoidance" (albeit not necessarily "semantic sensibility) it's necessary
// to clip the index to be within the range of the series.  In theory it
// would be possible to track the cases where clipping the index was needed
// or not, though it might be better to just lock the series being evaluated
// currently...this is an open question.

//
//  BASIC API: DO_NEXT_MAY_THROW and DO_ARRAY_THROWS
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is an optimized wrapper for the basic building block of Rebol
// evaluation.  They are macros designed to minimize overhead and be
// guaranteed to be inlined at the callsite.  For the central functionality,
// see `Do_Core()`.
//
// The optimized version of the macro will never do an evaluation of a type
// it doesn't have to.  It uses ANY_EVAL() to see if it can get out of making
// a function call...sometimes it cannot because there may be an infix lookup
// possible (we don't know that `[3] + [4]` isn't ever going to work...)  For
// this reason the optimization cannot work with a varargs list, as the
// va_list in C cannot be "peeked ahead at" and then put back (while the
// Rebol array data is random access).
//
// The debug build exercises both code paths, by optimizing every other
// execution to bypass the evaluator if possible...and then throwing
// the code through Do_Core the other times.  It's a sampling test, but
// not a bad one for helping keep the methods in sync.
//
// DO_NEXT_MAY_THROW takes in an array and a REBCNT offset into that array
// of where to execute.  Although the return value is a REBCNT, it is *NOT*
// always a series index!!!  It may return:
//
// DO_ARRAY_THROWS is another helper for the frequent case where one has a
// BLOCK! or a GROUP! at an index which already indicates the point where
// execution is to start.
//
// (The "Throws" name is because it's expected to usually be used in an
// 'if' statement.  It cues you into realizing that it returns TRUE if a
// THROW interrupts this current DO_BLOCK execution--not asking about a
// "THROWN" that happened as part of a prior statement.)
//
// If it returns FALSE, then the DO completed successfully to end of input
// without a throw...and the output contains the last value evaluated in the
// block (empty blocks give UNSET!).  If it returns TRUE then it will be the
// THROWN() value.

//
// These accessors are designed to make it convenient for natives and actions
// written in C to access their arguments and refinements.  They are able
// to bind to the implicit Reb_Call* passed to every REBNATIVE() and read
// the information out cleanly, like this:
//
//     PARAM(1, foo);
//     REFINE(2, bar);
//
//     if (IS_INTEGER(ARG(foo)) && REF(bar)) { ... }
//
// Under the hood `PARAM(1, foo)` and `REFINE(2, bar)` make const structs.
// In an optimized build, these structures disappear completely, with all
// addressing done directly into the call frame's cached `arg` pointer.
// It is also possible to get the typeset-with-symbol for a particular
// parameter or refinement, e.g. with `PAR(foo)` or `PAR(bar)`.
//
// The PARAM and REFINE macros use token pasting to name the variables they
// are declaring `p_name` instead of just `name`.  This prevents collisions
// with C++ identifiers, so PARAM(case) and REFINE(new) would make `p_case`
// and `p_new` instead of just `case` and `new` as the variable names.  (This
// is only visible in the debugger.)
//
// As a further aid, the debug build version of the structures contain the
// actual pointers to the arguments.  It also keeps a copy of a cache of the
// type for the arguments, because the numeric type encoding in the bits of
// the header requires a debug call (or by-hand-binary decoding) to interpret
// Whether a refinement was used or not at time of call is also cached.
