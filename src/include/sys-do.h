// The primary routine that performs DO and DO/NEXT is called Do_Core().  It
// takes a single parameter which holds the running state of the evaluator.
// This state may be allocated on the C variable stack:  Do_Core() is
// written such that a longjmp up to a failure handler above it can run
// safely and clean up even though intermediate stacks have vanished.
//
// Ren-C can run the evaluator across a REBARR-style series of input based on
// index.  It can also enumerate through C's `va_list`, providing the ability
// to pass pointers as REBVAL* to comma-separated input at the source level.
// (Someday it may fetch values from a standard C array of REBVAL[] as well.) 
//
// To provide even greater flexibility, it allows the very first element's
// pointer in an evaluation to come from an arbitrary source.  It doesn't
// have to be resident in the same sequence from which ensuing values are
// pulled, allowing a free head value (such as a FUNCTION! REBVAL in a local
// C variable) to be evaluated in combination from another source (like a
// va_list or series representing the arguments.)  This avoids the cost and
// complexity of allocating a series to combine the values together.
//
// These features alone would not cover the case when REBVAL pointers that
// are originating with C source were intended to be supplied to a function
// with no evaluation.  In R3-Alpha, the only way in an evaluative context
// to suppress such evaluations would be by adding elements (such as QUOTE).
// Besides the cost and labor of inserting these, the risk is that the
// intended functions to be called without evaluation, if they quoted
// arguments would then receive the QUOTE instead of the arguments.
//
// The problem was solved by adding a feature to the evaluator which was
// also opened up as a new privileged native called EVAL.  EVAL's refinements
// completely encompass evaluation possibilities in R3-Alpha, but it was also
// necessary to consider cases where a value was intended to be provided
// *without* evaluation.  This introduced EVAL/ONLY.
//


// Each iteration of DO bumps a global count, that in deterministic repro
// cases can be very helpful in identifying the "tick" where certain problems
// are occurring.  The SPORADICALLY() macro uses this to allow flipping
// between different behaviors in debug builds--usually to run the release
// behavior some of the time, and the debug behavior some of the time.  This
// exercises the release code path even when doing a debug build.

//
//  DO's LOWEST-LEVEL EVALUATOR HOOKING
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This API is used internally in the implementation of Do_Core.  It does
// not speak in terms of arrays or indices, it works entirely by setting
// up a call frame (f), and threading that frame's state through successive
// operations, vs. setting it up and disposing it on each DO/NEXT step.
//
// Like higher level APIs that move through the input series, this low-level
// API can move at full DO/NEXT intervals.  Unlike the higher APIs, the
// possibility exists to move by single elements at a time--regardless of
// if the default evaluation rules would consume larger expressions.  Also
// making it different is the ability to resume after a DO/NEXT on value
// sources that aren't random access (such as C's va_arg list).
//
// One invariant of access is that the input may only advance.  Before any
// operations are called, any low-level client must have already seeded
// f->value with a valid "fetched" REBVAL*.  END is not valid input, so
// callers beginning a Do_To_End must pre-check that condition themselves
// before calling Do_Core.  And if an operation sets the c->index to END_FLAG
// then that must be checked--it's not legal to call more operations on a
// call frame after a fetch reports the end.
//
// Operations are:
//
// Fetch_Next_In_Frame()
//
//      Retrieve next pointer for examination to f->value.  The previous
//      f->value pointer is overwritten.  (No REBVAL bits are moved by
//      this operation, only the 'currently processing' pointer reassigned.)
//      f->value may become an END marker...test with IS_END()
//
// Do_Next_In_Frame_May_Throw()
//
//      Executes the already-fetched pointer, consuming as much of the input
//      as necessary to complete a /NEXT (or failing with an error).  This
//      writes the computed REBVAL into a destination location.  After the
//      operation, the next f->value pointer will already be fetched and
//      waiting for examination or use.  The returned value may be THROWN(),
//      and IS_END(f->value) may be true after the operation.
//
// Quote_Next_In_Frame()
//
//      This operation is fairly trivial in the sense that it just assigns
//      the REBVAL bits pointed to by the current value to the destination
//      cell.  Then it does a simple fetch.  The main reason for making an
//      operation vs just having callers do the two steps is to monitor
//      when some of the input has been "consumed" vs. merely fetched.
//
// This is not intending to be a "published" API of Rebol/Ren-C.  But the
// privileged level of access can be used by natives that feel they can
// optimize performance by working with the evaluator directly.

// distances to be generalized, though this would cost a pointer size
// entity at each point.  The advantage of REB_INSTRUCTION is that only the
// clients using the esoteric ability would be paying anything for it or
// the API complexity, but if an important client like Ren-C++ it might
// be worth the savings.

// Note: Functionally it would be possible to assume a 0 index and require
// the caller to bump the value pointer as necessary.  But an index-based

//  Reify_Va_To_Array_In_Frame: C
//
// For performance and memory usage reasons, a variadic C function call that
// wants to invoke the evaluator with just a comma-delimited list of REBVAL*
// does not need to make a series to hold them.  Do_Core is written to use
// the va_list traversal as an alternate to DO-ing an ARRAY.
//
// However, va_lists cannot be backtracked once advanced.  So in a debug mode
// it can be helpful to turn all the va_lists into arrays before running
// them, so stack frames can be inspected more meaningfully--both for upcoming
// evaluations and those already past.
//
// A non-debug reason to reify a va_list into an array is if the garbage
// collector needs to see the upcoming values to protect them from GC.  In
// this case it only needs to protect those values that have not yet been
// consumed.
//
// Because items may well have already been consumed from the va_list() that
// can't be gotten back, we put in a marker to help hint at the truncation
// (unless told that it's not truncated, e.g. a debug mode that calls it
// before any items are consumed).

// (va_list by pointer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3369762/211160)
//
// Central routine for doing an evaluation of an array of values by calling
// a C function with those parameters (e.g. supplied as arguments, separated
// by commas).  Uses same method to do so as functions like printf() do.
//
// In R3-Alpha this style of invocation was specifically used to call single
// Rebol functions.  It would use a list of REBVAL*s--each of which could
// come from disjoint memory locations and be passed directly with no
// evaluation.  Ren-C replaced this entirely by adapting the evaluator to
// use va_arg() lists for the same behavior as a DO of an ARRAY.
//
// The previously accomplished style of execution with a function which may
// not be in the arglist can be accomplished using `opt_first` to put that
// function into the optional first position.  To instruct the evaluator not
// to do any evaluation on the values supplied as arguments after that
// (corresponding to R3-Alpha's APPLY/ONLY) then DO_FLAG_NO_ARGS_EVALUATE
// should be used--otherwise they will be evaluated normally.
//
// NOTE: Ren-C no longer supports the built-in ability to supply refinements
// positionally, due to the brittleness of this approach (for both system
// and user code).  The `opt_head` value should be made a path with the
// function at the head and the refinements specified there.  Future
// additions could do this more efficiently by allowing the refinement words
// to be pushed directly to the data stack.
//
// !!! C's va_lists are very dangerous, there is no type checking!  The
// C++ build should be able to check this for the callers of this function
// *and* check that you ended properly.  It means this function will need
// two different signatures (and so will each caller of this routine).
