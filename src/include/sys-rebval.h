// REBVAL is the structure/union for all Rebol values. It's designed to be
// four C pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes
// on 64-bit platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes,
// and there are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(REBVAL)` is the
// correct value for the platform.  But from a mechanical standpoint, the
// system should be *able* to work even if the size is different.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first is used for
// the value's "Header".  This includes the data type, such as REB_INTEGER,
// REB_BLOCK, REB_STRING, etc.  Then there are flags which are for general
// purposes that could apply equally well to any type of value (including
// whether the value should have a new-line after it when molded out inside
// of a block).  Followed by that are bits which are custom to each type (for
// instance whether a key in an object is hidden or not).
//
// Obviously, an arbitrary long string won't fit into the remaining 3*32 bits,
// or even 3*64 bits!  You can fit the data for an INTEGER or DECIMAL in that
// (at least until they become arbitrary precision) but it's not enough for
// a generic BLOCK! or a FUNCTION! (for instance).  So the remaining bits
// often will point to one or more Rebol "nodes" (see %sys-series.h for an
// explanation of REBSER, REBARR, REBCTX, and REBMAP.)
//
// So the next part of the structure is the "Extra".  This is the size of one
// pointer, which sits immediately after the header (that's also the size of
// one pointer).
//
// This sets things up for the "Payload"--which is the size of two pointers.
// It is broken into a separate structure at this position so that on 32-bit
// platforms, it can be aligned on a 64-bit boundary (assuming the REBVAL's
// starting pointer was aligned on a 64-bit boundary to start with).  This is
// important for 64-bit value processing on 32-bit platforms, which will
// either be slow or crash if reads of 64-bit floating points/etc. are done
// on unaligned locations.

//
// * Forward declarations are in %reb-defs.h
//
// * See %sys-rebnod.h for an explanation of FLAGIT_LEFT.  This file defines
//   those flags which are common to every value of every type.  Due to their
//   scarcity, they are chosen carefully.
//


//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  VALUE_FLAG_CONDITIONAL_FALSE
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This flag is used as a quick cache on BLANK! or LOGIC! false values.
// These are the only two values that return true from the FALSE? native
// (a.k.a. "conditionally false").  All other types are TRUE?.
//
// Because of this cached bit, LOGIC! does not need to store any data in its
// payload... its data of being true or false is already covered by this
// header bit.
//
// !!! Since tests for conditional truth or falsehood are extremely common
// (not just in IF and EITHER, but in CASE and ANY and many other constructs),
// it seems like a good optimization.  But it is a cache and could be done
// with a slightly more expensive test.  Given the scarcity of header bits in
// the modern codebase, this optimization may need to be sacrificed to
// reclaim the bit for a "higher purpose".
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_CONDITIONAL_FALSE \
    FLAGIT_LEFT(GENERAL_VALUE_BIT + 0)


//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  VALUE_FLAG_LINE
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is a line marker bit, such that when the value is molded it will put a
// newline before the value.  (The details are a little more subtle than that,
// because an ANY-PATH! could not be LOADed back if this were allowed.)
//
// The bit is set initially by what the scanner detects, and then left to the
// user's control after that.
//
// !!! The native `new-line` is used set this, which has a somewhat poor
// name considering its similarity to `newline` the line feed char.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_LINE \
    FLAGIT_LEFT(GENERAL_VALUE_BIT + 1)


//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  VALUE_FLAG_THROWN
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is how a REBVAL signals that it is a "throw" (e.g. a RETURN, BREAK,
// CONTINUE or generic THROW signal).
//
// The bit being set does not mean the cell contains the thrown quantity
// (e.g. it would not be the `1020` in `throw 1020`)  The evaluator thread
// enters a modal "thrown state", and it's the state which holds the value.
// It must be processed (or trigger an error) before another throw occurs.
//
// What the bit actually indicates is a cell containing the "label" or "name"
// of the throw.  Having the label quickly available in the slot being bubbled
// up makes it easy for recipients to decide if they are interested in throws
// of that type or not--after which they can request the thrown value.
//
// R3-Alpha code would frequently forget to check for thrown values, and
// wind up acting as if they did not happen.  In addition to enforcing that
// all thrown values are handled by entering a "thrown state" for the
// interpreter, all routines that can potentially return thrown values
// have been adapted to return a boolean and adopt the XXX_Throws()
// naming convention:
//
//     if (XXX_Throws()) {
//        /* handling code */
//     }
//

//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  VALUE_FLAG_RELATIVE
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This flag is used to indicate a value that needs to have a specific context
// added into it before it can have its bits copied--or used for some other
// purposes.
//
// An ANY-WORD! is relative if it refers to a local or argument of a function,
// and has its bits resident in the deep copy of that function's body.
//
// An ANY-ARRAY! in the deep copy of a function body must be relative also to
// the same function if it contains any instances of such relative words.
//

//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  VALUE_FLAG_UNEVALUATED
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Some functions wish to be sensitive to whether or not their argument came
// as a literal in source or as a product of an evaluation.  While all values
// carry the bit, it is only guaranteed to be meaningful on arguments in
// function frames...though it is valid on any result at the moment of taking
// it from Do_Core().
//
// It is in the negative sense because the act of requesting it is uncommon,
// e.g. from the QUOTE operator.  So most SET_BLANK() or other assignment
// should default to being "evaluative".
//
// !!! This concept is somewhat dodgy and experimental, but it shows promise
// in addressing problems like being able to give errors if a user writes
// something like `if [x > 2] [print "true"]` vs. `if x > 2 [print "true"]`,
// while still tolerating `item: [a b c] | if item [print "it's an item"]`. 
// That has a lot of impact for the new user experience.

//
//  VALUE_FLAG_STACK
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// When writing to a value cell, it is sometimes necessary to know how long
// that cell will "be alive".  This is important if there is some stack-based
// transient structure in the source cell, which would need to be converted
// into something longer-lived if the destination cell will outlive it.
//
// Hence cells must be formatted to say whether they are VALUE_FLAG_STACK or
// not, before any writing can be done to them.  If they are not then they
// are presumed to be indefinite lifetime (e.g. cells resident inside of an
// array managed by the garbage collector).
//
// But if a cell is marked with VALUE_FLAG_STACK, that means it is expected
// that scanning *backwards* in memory will find a specially marked REB_FRAME
// cell, which will lead to the frame to whose lifetime the cell is bound.
//
// !!! This feature is a work in progress.

// The value is defined to have the header, "extra", and payload.  Having
// the header come first is taken advantage of by the trick for allowing
// a single REBUPT-sized value (32-bit on 32 bit builds, 64-bit on 64-bit
// builds) be examined to determine if a value is an END marker or not.
//
// Conceptually speaking, one might think of the "extra" as being part of
// the payload.  But it is broken out into a separate union.  This is because
// the `binding` property is written using common routines for several
// different types.  If the common routine picked just one of the payload
// unions to initialize, it would "disengage" the other unions.
//
// (C permits *reading* of common leading elements from another union member,
// even if that wasn't the last union used to write it.  But all bets are off
// for other unions if you *write* a leading member through another one.
// For longwinded details: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11996970/211160 )

// Historically Rebol arrays were always one value longer than their maximum
// content, and this final slot was used for a special REBVAL called END!.
// Like a null terminator in a C string, it was possible to start from one
// point in the series and traverse to find the end marker without needing
// to maintain a count.  (Rebol series store their length also--but it's
// faster and more general to do traversals using the terminator.)
//
// Ren-C changed this so that end is not a data type, but a header bit.
// (See NODE_FLAG_END for an explanation of this choice.)  This means not only is
// a full REBVAL not needed to terminate, the sunk cost of an existing 32-bit
// or 64-bit number (depending on platform) can be used to avoid needing even
// 1/4 of a REBVAL for a header to terminate.
//
// !!! Because Rebol Arrays (REBARR) have both a length and a terminator, it
// is important to keep these in sync.  R3-Alpha sought to give code the
// freedom to work with unterminated arrays if the cost of writing terminators
// was not necessary.  Ren-C pushed back against this to try and be more
// uniform to get the invariants under control.  A formal balance is still
// being sought of when terminators will be required and when they will not.
//
// The debug build puts REB_MAX in the type slot of a REB_END, to help to
// distinguish it from the 0 that signifies an unset TRASH.  This means that
// any writable value can be checked to ensure it is an actual END marker
// and not "uninitialized".  This trick can only be used so long as REB_MAX
// is 63 or smaller (ensured by an assertion at startup ATM.

// A relative value is the identical struct to Reb_Value, but is allowed to

// in the C build, but the C++ build makes REBVAL a type derived from RELVAL.
//
// RELVAL exists to help quarantine the bit patterns for relative words into
// the deep-copied-body of the function they are for.  To actually look them
// up, they must be paired with a FRAME! matching the actual instance of the
// running function on the stack they correspond to.  Once made specific,
// a word may then be freely copied into any REBVAL slot.
//
// In addition to ANY-WORD!, an ANY-ARRAY! can also be relative, if it is
// part of the deep-copied function body.  The reason that arrays must be
// relative too is in case they contain relative words.  If they do, then
// recursion into them must carry forward the resolving "specifier" pointer
// to be combined with any relative words that are seen later.
