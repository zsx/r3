// in the debug build, as this data gathering is a sort of constant "tax" on
// the system.  While it might arguably be interesting to non-debug build
// users who are trying to optimize their code, the compromise of having to
// maintain the numbers suggests those users should be empowered with a debug
// build if they are doing such work (they should probably have one for other

// indeed "checked" builds given to those who had such interest.)

// There is a global hash table which accelerates finding a word's REBSER
