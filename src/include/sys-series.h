//
// Note: the word "Series" is overloaded in Rebol to refer to two related but
// distinct concepts:
//
// * The internal system datatype, also known as a REBSER.  It's a low-level
//   implementation of something similar to a vector or an array in other
//   languages.  It is an abstraction which represens a contiguous region
//   of memory containing equally-sized elements.
//
// * The user-level value type ANY-SERIES!.  This might be more accurately
//   called ITERATOR!, because it includes both a pointer to a REBSER of
//   data and an index offset into that data.  Attempts to reconcile all
//   the naming issues from historical Rebol have not yielded a satisfying
//   alternative, so the ambiguity has stuck.
//
// This file regards the first meaning of the word "series" and covers the
// low-level implementation details of a REBSER and its variants.  For info
// about the higher-level ANY-SERIES! value type and its embedded index,
// see %sys-value.h in the definition of `struct Reb_Any_Series`.
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A REBSER is a contiguous-memory structure with an optimization of behaving
// like a kind of "double-ended queue".  It is able to reserve capacity at
// both the tail and the head, and when data is taken from the head it will
// retain that capacity...reusing it on later insertions at the head.
//
// The space at the head is called the "bias", and to save on pointer math
// per-access, the stored data pointer is actually adjusted to include the
// bias.  This biasing is backed out upon insertions at the head, and also
// must be subtracted completely to free the pointer using the address
// originally given by the allocator.
//
// The element size in a REBSER is known as the "width".  It is designed
// to support widths of elements up to 255 bytes.  (See note on SER_FREED
// about accomodating 256-byte elements.)
//
// REBSERs may be either manually memory managed or delegated to the garbage
// collector.  Free_Series() may only be called on manual series.  See
// MANAGE_SERIES() and PUSH_GUARD_SERIES() for remarks on how to work safely
// with pointers to garbage-collected series, to avoid having them be GC'd
// out from under the code while working with them.
//
// This file defines series subclasses which are type-incompatible with
// REBSER for safety.  (In C++ they would be derived classes, so common
// operations would not require casting...but this is C.)  The subclasses
// are explained where they are defined.
//

//
// Note: Forward declarations are in %reb-defs.h
//

//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  REBSER (a.k.a. `struct Reb_Series`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This structure is a small descriptor for a series, and contains information
// about its content and flags.  Every string and block in REBOL has one.
//
// The REBSER is fixed-size, and is allocated as a "node" from a memory pool.
// That pool quickly grants and releases memory ranges that are sizeof(REBSER)
// without needing to use malloc() and free() for each individual allocation.
// These nodes can also be enumerated in the pool without needing the series
// to be tracked via a linked list or other structure.  The garbage collector
// is one example of code that performs such an enumeration.
//
// A REBSER node pointer will remain valid as long as outstanding references
// to the series exist in values visible to the GC.  On the other hand, the
// series's data pointer may be freed and reallocated to respond to the needs
// of resizing.  (In the future, it may be reallocated just as an idle task
// by the GC to reclaim or optimize space.)  Hence pointers into data in a
// managed series *must not be held onto across evaluations*.
//
// If the data requirements of a series are small, then rather than using the
// space in the REBSER to track a dynamic allocation, the data is included
// directly in the node itself.  The capacity is chosen to be exactly enough
// to store a single REBVAL so that length 0 or 1 series can be represented.
// However, that same amount of capacity may be used by arbitrary series (such
// as strings) if they too are small enough to fit.
//

// Series Flags
//
enum {
    // `SERIES_FLAG_0_IS_FALSE` represents the lowest bit and should always
    // be set to zero.  This is because it means that when Reb_Series_Content
    // is interpreted as a REBVAL's worth of data, then the info bits are in
    // a location where they do double-duty serving as an END marker.  For a
    // description of the method see notes on NOT_END_MASK.
    //
    SERIES_FLAG_0_IS_FALSE = 1 << 0,

    // `SERIES_FLAG_1_IS_FALSE` is the second lowest bit, and is set to zero
    // as a safety precaution.  In the debug build this is checked by value
    // writes to ensure that when the info flags are serving double duty
    // as an END marker, they do not get overwritten by rogue code that
    // thought a REBVAL* pointing at the memory had a full value's worth
    // of memory to write into.  See WRITABLE_MASK_DEBUG.
    //
    SERIES_FLAG_1_IS_FALSE = 1 << 1,

    // `SERIES_FLAG_HAS_DYNAMIC` indicates that this series has a dynamically
    // allocated portion.  If it does not, then its data pointer is the

    // `SERIES_FLAG_MARK` is used in the "mark and sweep" method of garbage
    // collection.  It is also used for other purposes which need to go
    // through and set a generic bit, e.g. to protect against loops in
    // the transitive closure ("if you hit a SER_MARK, then you've already
    // processed this series").
    //
    // Because of the dual purpose, it's important to be sure to not run
    // garbage collection while one of these alternate uses is in effect.
    // It's also important to reset the bit when done, as GC assumes when
    // it starts that all bits are cleared.  (The GC itself clears all
    // the bits by enumerating every series in the series pool during the
    // sweeping phase.)
    //
    // !!! With more series bits now available, the dual purpose is something
    // that should be reexamined--so long as bits are free, why reuse if it
    // creates more risk?

    SERIES_FLAG_MARK = 1 << 3,

    // `SERIES_FLAG_MANAGED` indicates that a series is managed by garbage
    // collection.  If this bit is not set, then during the GC's sweeping
    // phase the simple fact that it hasn't been SER_MARK'd won't be enough
    // to let it be considered for freeing.
    //
    // See MANAGE_SERIES for details on the lifecycle of a series (how it
    // starts out manually managed, and then must either become managed or be
    // freed before the evaluation that created it ends).

    // `SERIES_FLAG_ARRAY` indicates that this is a series of REBVAL values,
    // and suitable for using as the payload of an ANY-ARRAY! value.  When a
    // series carries this bit, that means that if it is also SER_MANAGED
    // then the garbage collector will process its transitive closure to
    // make sure all the values it contains (and the values its references
    // contain) do not have series GC'd out from under them.
    //
    // (In R3-Alpha, whether a series was an array or not was tested by if
    // its width was sizeof(REBVAL).  The Ren-C approach allows for the

    // the same size as a REBVAL, while not actually being REBVALs.)

    SERIES_FLAG_ARRAY = 1 << 5,

    // `ARRAY_FLAG_CONTEXT_VARLIST` indicates this series represents the
    // "varlist" of a context.  A second series can be reached from it via
    // the `->misc` field in the series node, which is a second array known

    // if one manages to get a raw pointer into a value in the series data
    // then by that point it cannot be enforced.
    //
    // !!! Could the 'writable' flag be used for this in the debug build,
    // if the locking process went through and cleared writability...then
    // put it back if the series were unlocked?
    //
    // This is related to the feature in PROTECT (OPT_TYPESET_LOCKED) which
    // protects a certain variable in a context from being changed.  Yet
    // it is distinct as it's a protection on a series itself--which ends
    // up affecting all variable content with that series in the payload.

    // `SERIES_FLAG_FIXED_SIZE` indicates the size is fixed, and the series

    // writable, assuming SERIES_FLAG_LOCKED isn't set.
    //
    // !!! Is there checking in all paths?  Do series contractions check this?
    //
    // One important reason for ensuring a series is fixed size is to avoid
    // the possibility of the data pointer being reallocated.  This allows
    // code to ignore the usual rule that it is unsafe to hold a pointer to
    // a value inside the series data.
    //
    // !!! Strictly speaking, SERIES_FLAG_NO_RELOCATE could be different
    // from fixed size... if there would be a reason to reallocate besides
    // changing size (such as memory compaction).
    //
    SERIES_FLAG_FIXED_SIZE  = 1 << 8,

    // `SERIES_FLAG_POWER_OF_2` is set when an allocation size was rounded to
    // a power of 2.  This flag was introduced in Ren-C when accounting was
    // added to make sure the system's notion of how much memory allocation
    // was outstanding would balance out to zero by the time of exiting the
    // interpreter.
    //
    // The problem was that the allocation size was measured in terms of the
    // number of elements.  If the elements themselves were not the size of
    // a power of 2, then to get an even power-of-2 size of memory allocated
    // the memory block would not be an even multiple of the element size.
    // Rather than track the actual memory allocation size as a 32-bit number,
    // a single bit flag remembering that the allocation was a power of 2
    // was enough to recreate the number to balance accounting at free time.
    //
    // !!! The rationale for why series were ever allocated to a power of 2
    // should be revisited.  Current conventional wisdom suggests that asking
    // for the amount of memory you need and not using powers of 2 is
    // generally a better idea:

    // for freeing it, so don't free() on GC.
    //
    // !!! It's not clear what the lifetime management of data used in this
    // way is.  If the external system receives no notice when Rebol is done
    // with the data and GC's the series, how does it know when it's safe
    // to free the data or not?  The feature is not used by the core or

    // fields and some fields in dynamic memory.  The foundation already
    // exists, and both can be stored in the same REBSER.  It's just a problem

    // a key/value pair) will require that object to make its own copy.

    // copy--even if expanding the same object by 1 item 100 times with no

//  BINARY and STRING series
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The current implementation of Rebol's ANY-STRING! type has two different
// series widths that are used.  One is the BYTE_SIZED() series which encodes
// ASCII in the low bits, and Latin-1 extensions in the range 0x80 - 0xFF.
// So long as a codepoint can fit in this range, the string can be stored in
// single bytes:
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block)
//
// (Note: This is not to be confused with the other "byte-width" encoding,
// which is UTF-8.  Rebol series routines are not set up to handle insertions
// or manipulations of UTF-8 encoded data in a Reb_Any_String payload at
// this time...it is a format used only in I/O.)
//
// The second format that is used puts codepoints into a 16-bit REBUNI-sized
// element.  If an insertion of a string or character into a byte sized
// string cannot be represented in 0xFF or lower, then the target string will
// be "widened"--doubling the storage space taken and requiring updating of
// the character data in memory.  At this time there are no "in-place"
// cases where a string is reduced from REBUNI to byte sized, but operations
// like Copy_String_Slimming() will scan a source string to see if a byte-size
// copy can be made from a REBUNI-sized one without loss of information.
//
// Byte-sized series are also used by the BINARY! datatype.  There is no
// technical difference between such series used as strings or used as binary,
// the difference comes from being marked REB_BINARY or REB_STRING in the
// header of the value carrying the series.
//
// For easier type-correctness, the series macros are given with names BIN_XXX
// and UNI_XXX.  There aren't distinct data types for the series themselves,
// just REBSER* is used.  Hence BIN_LEN() and UNI_LEN() aren't needed as you
// could just use SER_LEN(), but it helps a bit for readability...and an
// assert is included to ensure the size matches up.
