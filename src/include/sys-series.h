//  Summary: Definitions for Series (REBSER) plus Array, Frame, and Map
//  File: %sys-series.h
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Note: the word "Series" is overloaded in Rebol to refer to two related but
// distinct concepts:
//
// * The internal system datatype, also known as a REBSER.  It's a low-level
//   implementation of something similar to a vector or an array in other
//   languages.  It is an abstraction which represens a contiguous region
//   of memory containing equally-sized elements.
//
// * The user-level value type ANY-SERIES!.  This might be more accurately
//   called POSITION!, because it includes both a pointer to a REBSER of
//   data and an index offset into that data.  Attempts to reconcile all
//   the naming issues from historical Rebol have not yielded a satisfying
//   alternative, so the ambiguity has stuck.
//
// This file regards the first interpretation of the word series.  For more
// on the ANY-SERIES! value type and its embedded index, see %sys-value.h
// in the definition of `struct Reb_Any_Series`.
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A REBSER is a contiguous-memory structure with an optimization of behaving
// like a kind of "double-ended queue".  It is able to reserve capacity at
// both the tail and the head, and when data is taken from the head it will
// retain that capacity...reusing it on later insertions at the head.
//
// The space at the head is called the "bias", and to save on pointer math
// per-access, the stored data pointer is actually adjusted to include the
// bias.  This biasing is backed out upon insertions at the head, and also
// must be subtracted completely to free the pointer using the address
// originally given by the allocator.
//
// The element size in a REBSER is known as the "width".  It is designed
// to support widths of elements up to 255 bytes.  (See note on SERIES_FREED
// about accomodating 256-byte elements.)
//
// REBSERs may be either manually memory managed or delegated to the garbage
// collector.  Free_Series() may only be called on manual series.  See
// MANAGE_SERIES() and PUSH_GUARD_SERIES() for remarks on how to work safely
// with pointers to garbage collected series, to avoid having them be GC'd
// out from under the code while working with them.
//
// This file defines series subclasses which are type-incompatible with
// REBSER for safety.  (In C++ they would be derived classes, so common
// operations would not require casting...but this is C.)  The subclasses
// are explained where they are defined.
//


//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
//  REBSER (a.k.a. `struct Reb_Series`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This structure is a small fixed-size header for the series, containing
// information about its content.  Every string and block in REBOL uses one
// of these to permit GC and compaction.
//
// The REBSER is fixed-size, and is allocated as a "node" from a memory pool
// that quickly grants and releases memory ranges that are sizeof(REBSER)
// without needing to use malloc() and free() for each individual allocation.
// These nodes can also be enumerated in the pool without needing the series
// to be tracked via a linked list or other structure.  That enumeration is
// done for instance by the garbage collector.
//
// A REBSER node pointer will remain valid as long as outstanding references
// to the series exist in values visible to the GC.  On the other hand, the
// series's data pointer may be freed and reallocated to respond to the needs
// of resizing--and in the future may be reallocated just as an idle task
// by the GC to reclaim or optimize space.  Hence pointers into data in a
// managed series *must not be held onto across evaluations*.
//
// !!! An upcoming feature is the ability to avoid a dynamic allocation for
// the series data values in cases of short series (of lengths 0, 1, or
// perhaps even 2 or more if series nodes can be drawn from different pools).
// This would mean putting the values directly into the series node itself,
// and using the implicit terminating tricks of END to terminate with a
// misc pointer doing double duty for another purpose.  The groundwork is
// laid but there are still some details to work out.
//

//
// * "varlist" - an array of equal length to the keylist, which holds an
//   arbitrary REBVAL in each position that corresponds to its key.

// There is an additional aspect of a frame which is that it holds two
// extra values in the 0 slot of each array (hence indexing the keys and
// vars is done 1-based).
