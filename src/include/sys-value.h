//  Summary: Definitions for the Rebol Value Struct (REBVAL) and Helpers
//  File: %sys-value.h
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// REBVAL is the structure/union for all Rebol values. It's designed to be
// four C pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes
// on 64-bit platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes,
// and there are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(REBVAL)` is the
// correct value for the platform.  But from a mechanical standpoint, the
// system should be *able* to work even if the size is different.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first is used for
// the value's "Header".  This includes the data type, such as REB_INTEGER,
// REB_BLOCK, REB_STRING, etc.  Then there are 8 flags which are for general
// purposes that could apply equally well to any type of value (including
// whether the value should have a new-line after it when molded out inside
// of a block).  There are 8 bits which are custom to each type--for
// instance whether a key in an object is hidden or not.  Then there are
// 8 bits currently reserved for future use.
//
// The remaining content of the REBVAL struct is the "Payload".  It is the
// size of three (void*) pointers, and is used to hold whatever bits that
// are needed for the value type to represent itself.  Perhaps obviously,
// an arbitrarily long string will not fit into 3*32 bits, or even 3*64 bits!
// You can fit the data for an INTEGER or DECIMAL in that (at least until
// they become arbitrary precision) but it's not enough for a generic BLOCK!
// or a FUNCTION! (for instance).  So those pointers are used to point to
// things, and often they will point to one or more Rebol Series (see
// %sys-series.h for an explanation of REBSER, REBARR, REBCTX, and REBMAP.)
//
// While some REBVALs are in C stack variables, most reside in the allocated
// memory block for a Rebol series.  The memory block for a series can be
// resized and require a reallocation, or it may become invalid if the
// containing series is garbage-collected.  This means that many pointers to
// REBVAL are unstable, and could become invalid if arbitrary user code
// is run...this includes values on the data stack, which is implemented as
// a series under the hood.  (See %sys-stack.h)
//
// A REBVAL in a C stack variable does not have to worry about its memory
// address becoming invalid--but by default the garbage collector does not
// know that value exists.  So while the address may be stable, any series
// it has in the payload might go bad.  Use PUSH_GUARD_VALUE() to protect a
// stack variable's payload, and then DROP_GUARD_VALUE() when the protection
// is not needed.  (You must always drop the last guard pushed.)
//
// For a means of creating a temporary array of GC-protected REBVALs, see
// the "chunk stack" in %sys-stack.h.  This is used when building function
// argument frames, which means that the REBVAL* arguments to a function
// accessed via ARG() will be stable as long as the function is running.
//

//
// Note: Forward declarations are in %reb-defs.h

// Pushed here and popped at the end of the file to the previous value
//
// !!! Compilers are free to ignore pragmas (or error on them), and this can
// cause a loss of performance...so it might not be worth doing.  Especially
// because the ordering of fields in REBVAL members is alignment-conscious
// already.  Since Rebol series indexes (REBINT) and length counts (REBCNT)
// are still 32-bits on 64-bit platforms, it means that often REBINTs are
// "paired up" in structures to create a 64-bit alignment for a pointer
// that comes after them.  So everything is pretty well aligned as-is.

//  VALUE HEADER (`struct Reb_Value_Header`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The layout of the header corresponds to the following bitfield
// structure on big endian machines:
//
//    unsigned specific:16;     // flags that can apply to any REBVAL kind
//    unsigned general:8;       // flags that can apply to any kind of REBVAL
//    unsigned kind:6;          // underlying system datatype (64 kinds)
//    unsigned settable:1;      // for debug build only--"formatted" to write
//    unsigned not_end:1;       // not an end marker
//
// Due to a desire to be able to assign all the header bits in one go
// with a native-platform-sized int, this is done with bit masking.
// Using bitfields would bring in questions of how smart the
// optimizer is, as well as the endianness of the underlyling machine.
//
// We use REBUPT (Rebol's pre-C99 compatibility type for uintptr_t,
// which is just uintptr_t from C99 on).  Only the low 32 bits are used
// on 64-bit machines in order to make sure all the features work on
// 32-bit machines...but could be used for some optimization or caching
// purpose to enhance the 64-bit build.  No such uses implemented yet.
//

struct Reb_Value_Header {
    REBUPT bits;
};

// `NOT_END_MASK`
//
// If set, it means this is *not* an end marker.  The bit has been picked
// strategically to be in the negative sense, and in the lowest bit position.
// This means that any even-valued unsigned integer REBUPT value can be used
// to implicitly signal an end.
//
// If this bit is 0, it means that *no other header bits are valid*, as it
// may contain arbitrary data used for non-REBVAL purposes.
//
// Note that the value doing double duty as a number for one purpose and an
// END marker as another *must* be another REBUPT.  It cannot be a pointer
// (despite being guaranteed-REBUPT-sized, and despite having a value that
// is 0 when you mod it by 2.  So-called "type-punning" is unsafe with a
// likelihood of invoking "undefined behavior", while it's the compiler's
// responsibility to guarantee that pointers to memory of the same type of
// data be compatibly read-and-written.

//
// It's again a strategic choice--the 2nd lowest bit and in the negative.

//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Historically Rebol arrays were always one value longer than their maximum
// content, and this final slot was used for a special REBVAL called END!.
// Like a null terminator in a C string, it was possible to start from one
// point in the series and traverse to find the end marker without needing
// to maintain a count.  Rebol series store their length also--but it's
// faster and more general to use the terminator.
//
// Ren-C changed this so that end is not a data type, but rather seeing a
// header slot with the lowest bit set to 0.  (See NOT_END_MASK for
// an explanation of this choice.)  The upshot is that a data structure
// designed to hold Rebol arrays is able to terminate an array at full
// capacity with a pointer-sized integer with the lowest 2 bits clear, and
// use the rest of the bits for other purposes.  (See WRITABLE_MASK_DEBUG
// for why it's the low 2 bits and not just the lowest bit.)
//
// This means not only is a full REBVAL not needed to terminate, the sunk cost
// of an existing 32-bit or 64-bit number (depending on platform) can be used
// to avoid needing even 1/4 of a REBVAL for a header to terminate.  (See the
// `size` field in `struct Reb_Chunk` from %sys-stack.h for a simple example
// of the technique.)
//
// !!! Because Rebol Arrays (REBARR) have both a length and a terminator, it
// is important to keep these in sync.  R3-Alpha sought to give code the
// freedom to work with unterminated arrays if the cost of writing terminators
// was not necessary.  Ren-C pushed back against this to try and be more
// uniform to get the invariants under control.  A formal balance is still
// being sought of when terminators will be required and when they will not.

    // The thrown bit is being phased out, as the concept of a value itself
    // being "thrown" does not make a lot of sense, compared to the idea
    // that the evaluator itself is in a "throwing state".  If a thrown bit
    // can get on a value, then one has to worry about that value getting
    // copied and showing up somewhere that it doesn't make sense.
    //
    // Originally, R3-Alpha did not have a thrown bit on values, rather the
    // throw itself was represented as a certain kind of ERROR! value.  Ren-C
    // modifications extended THROW to allow a /NAME that could be a full
    // REBVAL (instead of a selection from a limited set of words).  This
    // made it possible to identify a throw by an object, function,
    // fully bound word, etc.
    //
    // But even after the change, the "thrown-ness" was still a property
    // of the "throw-name REBVAL".  By virtue of being a property on a
    // value *it could be dropped on the floor and ignored*.  There were
    // countless examples of this originating in the code.
    //
    // As part of the process of stamping out the idea that thrownness comes
    // from a value, all routines that can potentially return thrown values
    // have been adapted to return a boolean and adopt the XXX_Throws()
    // naming convention, so one can write:
    //
    //     if (XXX_Throws()) {
    //        /* handling code */
    //     }
    //
    // This forced every caller to consciously have a code path dealing with
    // potentially thrown values, reigning in the previous problems.  At
    // time of writing, the situation is much more under control, and natives
    // return a flag indicating that they wish to throw a value vs. return
    // one.  This is checked redundantly against the value bit for now, but
    // it is likely that the bit will be removed in favor of pushing the

//
// Though available to the user to manipulate directly as a TYPESET!, REBVALs
// of this category have another use in describing the fields of objects

// naming the field or parameter.
//

// on `struct Reb_Context` that are in %sys-series.h).
//
// Contexts coordinate with words, which can have their VAL_WORD_CONTEXT()

// corresponding var.  The key is a typeset which has several EXT flags
// controlling behaviors like whether the var is protected or hidden.
//
// !!! This "caching" mechanism is not actually "just a cache".  Once bound
// the index is treated as permanent.  This is why objects are "append only"
// because disruption of the index numbers would break the extant words
// with index numbers to that position.  Ren-C intends to undo this by
// paying for the check of the symbol number at the time of lookup, and if
// it does not match consider it a cache miss and re-lookup...adjusting the
// index inside of the word.  For efficiency, some objects could be marked
// as not having this property, but it may be just as efficient to check
// the symbol match as that bit.
