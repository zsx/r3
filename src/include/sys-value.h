//  Summary: Definitions for the Rebol Value Struct (REBVAL) and Helpers
//  File: %sys-value.h
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// REBVAL is the structure/union for all Rebol values. It's designed to be
// four C pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes
// on 64-bit platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes,
// and there are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(REBVAL)` is the
// correct value for the platform.  But from a mechanical standpoint, the
// system should be *able* to work even if the size is different.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first is used for
// the value's "Header".  This includes the data type, such as REB_INTEGER,
// REB_BLOCK, REB_STRING, etc.  Then there are 8 flags which are for general
// purposes that could apply equally well to any type of value (including
// whether the value should have a new-line after it when molded out inside
// of a block).  There are 8 bits which are custom to each type--for
// instance whether a key in an object is hidden or not.  Then there are
// 8 bits currently reserved for future use.
//
// The remaining content of the REBVAL struct is the "Payload".  It is the
// size of three (void*) pointers, and is used to hold whatever bits that
// are needed for the value type to represent itself.  Perhaps obviously,
// an arbitrarily long string will not fit into 3*32 bits, or even 3*64 bits!
// You can fit the data for an INTEGER or DECIMAL in that (at least until
// they become arbitrary precision) but it's not enough for a generic BLOCK!
// or a FUNCTION! (for instance).  So those pointers are used to point to
// things, and often they will point to one or more Rebol Series (see
// %sys-series.h for an explanation of REBSER, REBARR, REBFRM, and REBMAP.)
//
// While some REBVALs are in C stack variables, most reside in the allocated
// memory block for a Rebol series.  The memory block for a series can be
// resized and require a reallocation, or it may become invalid if the
// containing series is garbage-collected.  This means that many pointers to
// REBVAL are unstable, and could become invalid if arbitrary user code
// is run...this includes values on the data stack, which is implemented as
// a series under the hood.  (See %sys-stack.h)
//
// A REBVAL in a C stack variable does not have to worry about its memory
// address becoming invalid--but by default the garbage collector does not
// know that value exists.  So while the address may be stable, any series
// it has in the payload might go bad.  Use PUSH_GUARD_VALUE() to protect a
// stack variable, and then DROP_GUARD_VALUE() when the protection is not
// needed.  (You must always drop the last guard pushed.)
//
// For a means of creating a temporary array of GC-protected REBVALs, see
// the "chunk stack" in %sys-stack.h.  This is used when building function
// argument frames, which means that the REBVAL* arguments to a function
// accessed via ARG() will be stable as long as the function is running.

// !!! Compilers are free to ignore pragmas (or error on them), and this can
// cause a loss of performance...so it might not be worth doing.  Especially
// because the ordering of fields in REBVAL members is alignment-conscious
// already.  Since Rebol series indexes (REBINT) and length counts (REBCNT)
// are still 32-bits on 64-bit platforms, it means that often REBINTs are
// "paired up" in structures to create a 64-bit alignment for a pointer
// that comes after them.  So everything is pretty well aligned as-is.

//  VALUE HEADER (`struct Reb_Value_Header`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The value header separates its content into 4 8-bit bitfields.  As the
// order of bitfields is unspecified by the C standard, R3-Alpha used a
// switch in compilation to specify the two most common layout variants:
// ENDIAN_BIG and ENDIAN_LITTLE.  A runtime test in %b-init.c verifies that
// the lower 8 bits is bitfields.opts, and hence a test for OPT_VALUE_NOT_END
// is merely a test for an odd value of the header.
//
// !!! Though this has worked in practice on all the platforms used so far,
// it reaches beneath the C abstraction layer and doesn't really need to.
// And it violates the rule that when one member of a union is assigned
// then the other values are considered invalid.  Bit masking of an
// ordinary unsigned number could be used instead:
//
//    http://stackoverflow.com/a/1053281/211160

    // that the evaluator itself is in a "throwing state".  If a thrown bit
    // can get on a value, then one has to worry about that value getting
    // copied and showing up somewhere that it doesn't make sense.
    //
    // Originally, R3-Alpha did not have a thrown bit on values, rather the
    // throw itself was represented as a certain kind of ERROR! value.  Ren-C
    // modifications extended THROW to allow a /NAME that could be a full
    // REBVAL (instead of a selection from a limited set of words).  This
    // made it possible to identify a throw by an object, function,
    // fully bound word, etc.
    //
    // But even after the change, the "thrown-ness" was still a property
    // of the "throw-name REBVAL".  By virtue of being a property on a
    // value *it could be dropped on the floor and ignored*.  There were
    // countless examples of this originating in the code.
    //
    // As part of the process of stamping out the idea that thrownness comes
    // from a value, all routines that can potentially return thrown values
    // have been adapted to return a boolean and adopt the XXX_Throws()
    // naming convention, so one can write:
    //
    //     if (XXX_Throws()) {
    //        /* handling code */
    //     }
    //
    // This forced every caller to consciously have a code path dealing with
    // potentially thrown values, reigning in the previous problems.  At
    // time of writing, the situation is much more under control, and natives
    // return a flag indicating that they wish to throw a value vs. return
    // one.  This is checked redundantly against the value bit for now, but
    // it is likely that the bit will be removed in favor of pushing the
    // responsibility into the evaluator state.

//
// Historically Rebol arrays were always one value longer than their maximum
// content, and this final slot was used for a special REBVAL called END!.
// Like a null terminator in a C string, it was possible to start from one
// point in the series and traverse to find the end marker without needing
// to maintain a count.  Rebol series store their length also--but it's
// faster and more general to use the terminator.
//
// Ren-C changed this so that end is not a data type, but rather seeing a
// header slot with the lowest bit set to 0.  (See OPTS_VALUE_NOT_END for
// an explanation of this choice.)  The upshot is that a data structure
// designed to hold Rebol arrays is able to terminate an array at full
// capacity with a pointer-sized value with the lowest 2 bits clear, and
// use the rest of the bits for other purposes.  (See OPTS_VALUE_REBVAL_DEBUG
// for why it's the low 2 bits and not just the lowest bit.)
//
// This means not only is a full REBVAL not needed to terminate, the sunk cost
// of an existing pointer can be used to avoid needing even 1/4 of a REBVAL
// for a header to terminate.  (See the `prev` pointer in `struct Reb_Chunk`
// from %sys-stack.h for a simple example of the technique.)
//
// !!! Because Rebol Arrays (REBARR) have both a length and a terminator, it
// is important to keep these in sync.  R3-Alpha sought to give code the
// freedom to work with unterminated arrays if the cost of writing terminators
// was not necessary.  Ren-C pushed back against this to try and be more
// uniform to get the invariants under control.  A formal balance is still
// being sought of when terminators will be required and when they will not.

// it means one of the 64-bits in a typeset is always available for another
// use (as trash is not ever supposed to be seen by the user...)
//
// It's intended to be a value written into cells in the debug build when
// the cell is expected to be overwitten with valid data.  By default, the
// garbage collector will raise an alert if a TRASH! value is not overwritten
// by the time it sees it...and any attempt to read the type of a trash
// value with VAL_TYPE() will cause the debug build to assert.  Hence it
// must be tested for specially.
//
// There are some uses of trash which the GC should be able to run while it
// is extant.  For example, when a native function is called the cell where
// it is supposed to write its output is set to trash.  However, the garbage
// collector may run before the native has written its result...so for these
// cases, use SET_TRASH_SAFE().  It will still trigger assertions if other
// code tries to use it--it's just that the GC will treat it like an UNSET!.
//
// The operations for setting trash are available in both debug and release
// builds.  An unsafe trash set turns into a NOOP in release builds (it will
// be "trash" in the sense of being uninitialized memory).  Meanwhile a safe
// trash set turns into a SET_UNSET() in release builds--so for instance any
// native that does not write its return result will return unset in release
// builds.  IS_TRASH_DEBUG() can be used to test for trash in debug builds,
// but not in release builds...as there is no test for "uninitialized memory".
//
// Because the trash value saves the filename and line where it originated,

/***********************************************************************
**
**	CONTEXTS
**
**	The Reb_Context is the basic struct used currently for OBJECT!,
**	MODULE!, ERROR!, and PORT!...providing behaviors common to ANY-CONTEXT!
**
**	It implements a key/value pairing via two parallel series, whose indices
**	line up in a correspondence.  The "keylist" series contains REBVALs that
**	are symbol IDs encoded as an extra piece information inside of a TYPESET!.
**	The "value" REBVALs are in a series called the "frame", which lines up at
**	the index appropriate for the key.  The index into these series is used
**	in the "binding" of a WORD! for cached lookup so that the symbol does not
**	need to be searched for each time.
**
**	!!! This "caching" mechanism is not actually "just a cache".  Once bound
**	the index is treated as permanent.  This is why objects are "append only"
**	because disruption of the index numbers would break the extant words
**	with index numbers to that position.  Ren-C intends to undo this by
**	paying for the check of the symbol number at the time of lookup, and if
**	it does not match consider it a cache miss and re-lookup...adjusting the
**	index inside of the word.  For efficiency, some objects could be marked
**	as not having this property, but it may be just as efficient to check
**	the symbol match as that bit.
**
**	The indices start at 1, which leaves an open slot at the zero position in
**	both the keylist and the frame.  The frame uses this slot to hold the
**	value of the OBJECT! itself.  This trick allows the single frame REBSER
**	pointer to be passed around rather than the REBVAL struct which is 4x
**	larger, yet still reconstitute the REBVAL if it is needed.
**
**	Because a REBSER which contains an object at its head is uniquely capable
**	of retrieving the keylist by digging into its implicit first OBJECT!
**	value, it is often considered a unique type called a "frame", and
**  passed around as a type that checks differently known as a REBFRM.

//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//

// Reb_All is a structure type designed specifically for getting at
// the underlying bits of whichever union member is in effect inside
// the Reb_Value_Data.  This is in order to hash the values in a
// generic way that can use the bytes and doesn't have to be custom
// to each type.  Though many traditional methods of doing this "type
// punning" might generate arbitrarily broken code, this is being
// done through a union, for which C99 expanded the "legal" uses:
