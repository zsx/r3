//  Summary: Definitions for the Rebol Value Struct (REBVAL) and Helpers
//  File: %sys-value.h
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// REBVAL is the structure/union for all Rebol values. It's designed to be
// four C pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes
// on 64-bit platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes,
// and there are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(REBVAL)` is the
// correct value for the platform.  But from a mechanical standpoint, the
// system should be *able* to work even if the size is different.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first is used for
// the value's "Header".  This includes the data type, such as REB_INTEGER,
// REB_BLOCK, REB_STRING, etc.  Then there are 8 flags which are for general
// purposes that could apply equally well to any type of value (including
// whether the value should have a new-line after it when molded out inside
// of a block).  There are 8 bits which are custom to each type--for
// instance whether a key in an object is hidden or not.  Then there are
// 8 bits currently reserved for future use.
//
// The remaining content of the REBVAL struct is the "Payload".  It is the
// size of three (void*) pointers, and is used to hold whatever bits that
// are needed for the value type to represent itself.  Perhaps obviously,
// an arbitrarily long string will not fit into 3*32 bits, or even 3*64 bits!
// You can fit the data for an INTEGER or DECIMAL in that (at least until
// they become arbitrary precision) but it's not enough for a generic BLOCK!
// or a FUNCTION! (for instance).  So those pointers are used to point to
// things, and often they will point to one or more Rebol Series (see
// %sys-series.h for an explanation of REBSER, REBARR, REBCON, and REBMAP.)
//
// While some REBVALs are in C stack variables, most reside in the allocated
// memory block for a Rebol series.  The memory block for a series can be
// resized and require a reallocation, or it may become invalid if the
// containing series is garbage-collected.  This means that many pointers to
// REBVAL are unstable, and could become invalid if arbitrary user code
// is run...this includes values on the data stack, which is implemented as
// a series under the hood.  (See %sys-stack.h)
//
// A REBVAL in a C stack variable does not have to worry about its memory
// address becoming invalid--but by default the garbage collector does not
// know that value exists.  So while the address may be stable, any series
// it has in the payload might go bad.  Use PUSH_GUARD_VALUE() to protect a
// stack variable, and then DROP_GUARD_VALUE() when the protection is not
// needed.  (You must always drop the last guard pushed.)
//
// For a means of creating a temporary array of GC-protected REBVALs, see
// the "chunk stack" in %sys-stack.h.  This is used when building function
// argument frames, which means that the REBVAL* arguments to a function
// accessed via ARG() will be stable as long as the function is running.

// !!! Compilers are free to ignore pragmas (or error on them), and this can
// cause a loss of performance...so it might not be worth doing.  Especially
// because the ordering of fields in REBVAL members is alignment-conscious
// already.  Since Rebol series indexes (REBINT) and length counts (REBCNT)
// are still 32-bits on 64-bit platforms, it means that often REBINTs are
// "paired up" in structures to create a 64-bit alignment for a pointer
// that comes after them.  So everything is pretty well aligned as-is.

//  VALUE HEADER (`struct Reb_Value_Header`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The layout of the header corresponds to the following bitfield
// structure on big endian machines:
//
//    unsigned resv:8;      // !!! <reserved for future use>
//    unsigned exts:8;      // extensions to datatype
//    unsigned opts:8;      // options that can apply to any value
//    unsigned type:6;      // datatype (64 possibilities)
//    unsigned settable:1;  // Debug build only--"formatted" for setting
//    unsigned not_end:1;   // not an end marker
//
// Due to a desire to be able to assign all the header bits in one go
// with a native-platform-sized int, this is done with bit masking.
// Using bitfields would bring in questions of how smart the
// optimizer is, as well as the endianness of the underlyling machine.
//
// We use REBUPT (Rebol's pre-C99 compatibility type for uintptr_t,
// which is just uintptr_t from C99 on).  Only the low 32 bits are used
// on 64-bit machines in order to make sure all the features work on
// 32-bit machines...but could be used for some optimization or caching
// purpose to enhance the 64-bit build.  No such uses implemented yet.
//

struct Reb_Value_Header {
    REBUPT all;
};

// `NOT_END_MASK`
//
// If set, it means this is *not* an end marker.  The bit is picked
// strategically to be in the negative and in the lowest order position.
// This means that any even pointer-sized value (such as...all pointers)
// will have its zero bit set, and thus implicitly signal an end.
//
// If this bit is 0, it means that *no other header bits are valid*,
// as it may contain arbitrary data used for non-REBVAL purposes.
//
#define NOT_END_MASK 0x01

// `WRITABLE_MASK_DEBUG`
//
// This is for the debug build, to make it safer to use the implementation
// trick of NOT_END_MASK.  It indicates the slot is "REBVAL sized", and can
// be written into--including to be written with SET_END().
//
// It's again a strategic choice--the 2nd lowest bit and in the negative.
// On *most* known platforms, testing an arbitrary pointer value for
// this bit will give 0 and suggest it is *not* a REBVAL (while still
// indicating an END because of the 0 in the lowest bit).  By checking the
// bit before writing a header, a pointer within a container doing
// double-duty as an implicit terminator for the contained values can
// trigger an alert if the values try to overwrite it.
//
// !!! This checking feature is not fully implemented, but will be soon.

//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Historically Rebol arrays were always one value longer than their maximum
// content, and this final slot was used for a special REBVAL called END!.
// Like a null terminator in a C string, it was possible to start from one
// point in the series and traverse to find the end marker without needing
// to maintain a count.  Rebol series store their length also--but it's
// faster and more general to use the terminator.
//
// Ren-C changed this so that end is not a data type, but rather seeing a
// header slot with the lowest bit set to 0.  (See NOT_END_MASK for
// an explanation of this choice.)  The upshot is that a data structure
// designed to hold Rebol arrays is able to terminate an array at full
// capacity with a pointer-sized value with the lowest 2 bits clear, and
// use the rest of the bits for other purposes.  (See WRITABLE_MASK_DEBUG
// for why it's the low 2 bits and not just the lowest bit.)
//
// This means not only is a full REBVAL not needed to terminate, the sunk cost
// of an existing pointer can be used to avoid needing even 1/4 of a REBVAL
// for a header to terminate.  (See the `prev` pointer in `struct Reb_Chunk`
// from %sys-stack.h for a simple example of the technique.)
//
// !!! Because Rebol Arrays (REBARR) have both a length and a terminator, it
// is important to keep these in sync.  R3-Alpha sought to give code the
// freedom to work with unterminated arrays if the cost of writing terminators
// was not necessary.  Ren-C pushed back against this to try and be more
// uniform to get the invariants under control.  A formal balance is still
// being sought of when terminators will be required and when they will not.
//

// The debug build puts REB_MAX in the type slot, to distinguish it from the
// 0 that signifies REB_TRASH.  That can be checked to ensure a writable
// value isn't a trash, but a non-writable value (e.g. a pointer) could be
// any bit pattern in the type slot.  Only check if it's a Rebol-initialized
// value slot...and then, tolerate "GC safe trash" (an unset in release)

    // set it to 0.
    //
    // This means that a LOGIC! does not need to use its data payload, and
    // can just check this bit to know if it is true or false.  Also, testing
    // for something being (LOGIC! TRUE) or (LOGIC! FALSE) can be done with

    //
    // The thrown bit is being phased out, as the concept of a value itself
    // being "thrown" does not make a lot of sense, compared to the idea
    // that the evaluator itself is in a "throwing state".  If a thrown bit
    // can get on a value, then one has to worry about that value getting
    // copied and showing up somewhere that it doesn't make sense.
    //
    // Originally, R3-Alpha did not have a thrown bit on values, rather the
    // throw itself was represented as a certain kind of ERROR! value.  Ren-C
    // modifications extended THROW to allow a /NAME that could be a full
    // REBVAL (instead of a selection from a limited set of words).  This
    // made it possible to identify a throw by an object, function,
    // fully bound word, etc.
    //
    // But even after the change, the "thrown-ness" was still a property
    // of the "throw-name REBVAL".  By virtue of being a property on a
    // value *it could be dropped on the floor and ignored*.  There were
    // countless examples of this originating in the code.
    //
    // As part of the process of stamping out the idea that thrownness comes
    // from a value, all routines that can potentially return thrown values
    // have been adapted to return a boolean and adopt the XXX_Throws()
    // naming convention, so one can write:
    //
    //     if (XXX_Throws()) {
    //        /* handling code */
    //     }
    //
    // This forced every caller to consciously have a code path dealing with
    // potentially thrown values, reigning in the previous problems.  At
    // time of writing, the situation is much more under control, and natives
    // return a flag indicating that they wish to throw a value vs. return
    // one.  This is checked redundantly against the value bit for now, but
    // it is likely that the bit will be removed in favor of pushing the
    // responsibility into the evaluator state.
    //
    OPT_VALUE_THROWN,

    // This is a bit used in conjunction with OPT_VALUE_THROWN, which could

// use (as trash is not ever supposed to be seen by the user...)
//
// It's intended to be a value written into cells in the debug build when
// the cell is expected to be overwitten with valid data.  By default, the
// garbage collector will raise an alert if a TRASH! value is not overwritten
// by the time it sees it...and any attempt to read the type of a trash
// value with VAL_TYPE() will cause the debug build to assert.  Hence it
// must be tested for specially.
//
// There are some uses of trash which the GC should be able to run while it
// is extant.  For example, when a native function is called the cell where
// it is supposed to write its output is set to trash.  However, the garbage
// collector may run before the native has written its result...so for these
// cases, use SET_TRASH_SAFE().  It will still trigger assertions if other
// code tries to use it--it's just that the GC will treat it like an UNSET!.
//
// The operations for setting trash are available in both debug and release
// builds.  An unsafe trash set turns into a NOOP in release builds (it will
// be "trash" in the sense of being uninitialized memory).  Meanwhile a safe
// trash set turns into a SET_UNSET() in release builds--so for instance any
// native that does not write its return result will return unset in release
// builds.  IS_TRASH_DEBUG() can be used to test for trash in debug builds,
// but not in release builds...as there is no test for "uninitialized memory".
//
// Because the trash value saves the filename and line where it originated,
// the REBVAL has that info in debug builds to inspect in its `trash` union
// member.  It also saves the Do tick count in which it was created, to
// make it easier to pinpoint precisely when it came into existence.
//
// !!! If we're not using TRACK_EMPTY_PAYLOADS, should this POISON_MEMORY() on
// the payload to help catch invalid reads?  Trash values don't hang around
// that long, except for the case of the values in the extra "->rest" capacity
// of series.  Would that be too many memory poisonings to handle efficiently?

// ANY-CONTEXT! (`struct Reb_Any_Context`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The Reb_Any_Context is the basic struct used currently for OBJECT!,
// MODULE!, ERROR!, and PORT!.  It builds upon the context datatype REBCON,
// which permits the storage of associated KEYS and VARS.  (See the comments
// on `struct Reb_Context` that are in %sys-series.h).
//
// Contexts coordinate with words, which can have their VAL_WORD_CONTEXT()
// set to a context's series pointer.  Then they cache the index of that
// word's symbol in the context's keylist, for a fast lookup to get to the
// corresponding var.  The key is a typeset which has several EXT flags
// controlling behaviors like whether the var is protected or hidden.
//
// !!! This "caching" mechanism is not actually "just a cache".  Once bound
// the index is treated as permanent.  This is why objects are "append only"
// because disruption of the index numbers would break the extant words
// with index numbers to that position.  Ren-C intends to undo this by
// paying for the check of the symbol number at the time of lookup, and if
// it does not match consider it a cache miss and re-lookup...adjusting the
// index inside of the word.  For efficiency, some objects could be marked
// as not having this property, but it may be just as efficient to check
// the symbol match as that bit.
//
// Frame key/var indices start at one, and they leave two REBVAL slots open
// in the 0 spot for other uses.  With an ANY-CONTEXT!, the use for the
// "ROOTVAR" is to store a canon value image of the ANY-CONTEXT!'s REBVAL
// itself.  This trick allows a single REBSER* to be passed around rather
// than the REBVAL struct which is 4x larger, yet still reconstitute the
