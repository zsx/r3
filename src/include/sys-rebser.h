//
// This contains the struct definition for the "REBSER" struct Reb_Series.
// It is a small-ish descriptor for a series (though if the amount of data
// in the series is small enough, it is embedded into the structure itself.)
//
// Every string, block, path, etc. in Rebol has a REBSER.  The implementation
// of them is reused in many places where Rebol needs a general-purpose
// dynamically growing structure.  It is also used for fixed size structures
// which would like to participate in garbage collection.
//
// The REBSER is fixed-size, and is allocated as a "node" from a memory pool.
// That pool quickly grants and releases memory ranges that are sizeof(REBSER)
// without needing to use malloc() and free() for each individual allocation.
// These nodes can also be enumerated in the pool without needing the series
// to be tracked via a linked list or other structure.  The garbage collector
// is one example of code that performs such an enumeration.
//
// A REBSER node pointer will remain valid as long as outstanding references
// to the series exist in values visible to the GC.  On the other hand, the
// series's data pointer may be freed and reallocated to respond to the needs
// of resizing.  (In the future, it may be reallocated just as an idle task
// by the GC to reclaim or optimize space.)  Hence pointers into data in a
// managed series *must not be held onto across evaluations*, without
// special protection or accomodation.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * For the forward declarations of series subclasses, see %reb-defs.h
//
// * Because a series contains a union member that embeds a REBVAL directly,
//   `struct Reb_Value` must be fully defined before this file can compile.
//   Hence %sys-rebval.h must already be included.
//
// * For the API of operations available on REBSER types, see %sys-series.h
//
// * REBARR is a series that contains Rebol values (REBVALs).  It has many
//   concerns specific to special treatment and handling, in interaction with
//   the garbage collector as well as handling "relative vs specific" values.
//
// * Several related types (REBFUN for function, REBCTX for context) are
//   actually stylized arrays.  They are laid out with special values in their
//   content (e.g. at the [0] index), or by links to other series in their
//   `->misc` field of the REBSER node.  Hence series are the basic building
//   blocks of nearly all variable-size structures in the system.
//

//
// SERIES <<HEADER>> FLAGS
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Series have two places to store bits...in the "header" and in the "info".
// The following are the SERIES_FLAG_XXX that are used in the header, while
// the SERIES_INFO_XXX flags will be found in the info.
//
// As a general rule for choosing which place to put a bit, if it may be
// interesting to test/set multiple bits at the same time, then they should
// be in the same flag group.  Also, SERIES_FLAG_XXX are passed to the
// Make_Series() function, so anything that controls series creation is best
// put in there.
//
// !!! Perhaps things that don't change for the lifetime of the series should
// also prefer the header vs. info?  Such separation might help with caching.
//

//=//// ARRAY_FLAG_VOIDS_LEGAL ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Identifies arrays in which it is legal to have void elements.  This is true
// for instance on reified C va_list()s which were being used for unevaluated
// applies (like R3-Alpha's APPLY/ONLY).  When those va_lists need to be put
// into arrays for the purposes of GC protection, they may contain voids which
// they need to track.
//
// Note: ARRAY_FLAG_VARLIST also implies legality of voids, which
// are used to represent unset variables.
//
#define ARRAY_FLAG_VOIDS_LEGAL \
    NODE_FLAG_SPECIAL


//=//// SERIES_FLAG_FIXED_SIZE ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This means a series cannot be expanded or contracted.  Values within the
// series are still writable (assuming it isn't otherwise locked).
//
// !!! Is there checking in all paths?  Do series contractions check this?
//
// One important reason for ensuring a series is fixed size is to avoid
// the possibility of the data pointer being reallocated.  This allows
// code to ignore the usual rule that it is unsafe to hold a pointer to
// a value inside the series data.
//
// !!! Strictly speaking, SERIES_FLAG_NO_RELOCATE could be different
// from fixed size... if there would be a reason to reallocate besides
// changing size (such as memory compaction).
//

    FLAGIT_LEFT(GENERAL_SERIES_BIT + 0)


//=//// SERIES_FLAG_FILE_LINE /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The Reb_Series node has two pointers in it, ->link and ->misc, which are
// used for a variety of purposes (pointing to the keylist for an object,
// the C code that runs as the dispatcher for a function, etc.)  But for
// regular source series, they can be used to store the filename and line
// number, if applicable.

//
// Indicates the series holds a UTF-8 encoded string.
//
// !!! Currently this is only used to store ANY-WORD! symbols, which are
// read-only and cannot be indexed into, e.g. with `next 'foo`.  This is
// because UTF-8 characters are encoded at variable sizes, and the series
// indexing does not support that at this time.  However, it would be nice
// if a way could be figured out to unify ANY-STRING! with ANY-WORD! somehow
// in order to implement the "UTF-8 Everywhere" manifesto:

//=//// SERIES_FLAG_POWER_OF_2 ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is set when an allocation size was rounded to a power of 2.  The bit
// was introduced in Ren-C when accounting was added to make sure the system's
// notion of how much memory allocation was outstanding would balance out to
// zero by the time of exiting the interpreter.
//
// The problem was that the allocation size was measured in terms of the
// number of elements in the series.  If the elements themselves were not the
// size of a power of 2, then to get an even power-of-2 size of memory
// allocated, the memory block would not be an even multiple of the element
// size.  So rather than track the "actual" memory allocation size as a 32-bit
// number, a single bit flag remembering that the allocation was a power of 2
// was enough to recreate the number to balance accounting at free time.
//
// !!! The original code which created series with items which were not a
// width of a power of 2 was in the FFI.  It has been rewritten to not use
// such custom structures, but the support for this remains in case there
// was a good reason to have a non-power-of-2 size in the future.
//
// !!! ...but rationale for why series were ever allocated to a power of 2
// should be revisited.  Current conventional wisdom suggests that asking
// for the amount of memory you need and not using powers of 2 is
// generally a better idea:

//
// Indicates that this is a series of REBVAL value cells, and suitable for
// using as the payload of an ANY-ARRAY! value.  When a series carries this
// bit, then if it is also NODE_FLAG_MANAGED the garbage ollector will process
// its transitive closure to make sure all the values it contains (and the
// values its references contain) do not have series GC'd out from under them.
//
// Note: R3-Alpha used `SER_WIDE(s) == sizeof(REBVAL)` as the test for if
// something was an array.  But this allows creation of series that have
// items which are incidentally the size of a REBVAL, but not actually arrays.

// !!! Ultimately this flag may be unnecessary because stack-based and

//
// SERIES NODE ("REBSER") STRUCTURE DEFINITION
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A REBSER node is the size of two REBVALs, and there are 3 basic layouts
// which can be overlaid inside the node:
//
//      Dynamic: [header [allocation tracking] info link misc]
//     Singular: [header [REBVAL cell] info link misc]
//      Pairing: [[REBVAL cell] [REBVAL cell]]
//
// `info` is not the start of a "Rebol Node" (REBNODE, e.g. either a REBSER or
// a REBVAL cell).  But in the singular case it is positioned right where
// the next cell after the embedded cell *would* be.  Hence the bit in the
// info corresponding to NODE_FLAG_END is set, making it conform to the
// "terminating array" pattern.  To lower the risk of this implicit terminator
// being accidentally overwritten (which would corrupt link and misc), the
// bit corresponding to NODE_FLAG_CELL is clear.
//
// Singulars have widespread applications in the system, notably the
// efficient implementation of FRAME!.  They also narrow the gap in overhead
// between COMPOSE [A (B) C] vs. REDUCE ['A B 'C] such that the memory cost
// of the array is nearly the same as just having another value in the array.
//
// Pair REBSERs are allocated from the REBSER pool instead of their own to
// help exchange a common "currency" of allocation size more efficiently.
// They are planned for use in the PAIR! and MAP! datatypes, and anticipated
// to play a crucial part in the API--allowing a persistent handle for a
// GC'able REBVAL and associated "meta" value (which can be used for
// reference counting or other tracking.)
//
// Most of the time, code does not need to be concerned about distinguishing
// Pair from the Dynamic and Singular layouts--because it already knows
// which kind it has.  Only the GC needs to be concerned when marking
// and sweeping.
