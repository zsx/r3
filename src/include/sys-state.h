**  Summary: CPU State
**  Module:  sys-state.h
**  Author:  Carl Sassenrath, @HostileFork
**  Notes:
**		Rebol is settled upon a stable and pervasive implementation
**		baseline of ANSI-C (C89).  That commitment provides certain
**		advantages.  One of the disadvantages is that there is no safe
**		way to do non-local jumps with stack unwinding (as in C++).  If
**		you've written some code that performs a raw malloc and then
**		wants to "throw" with a longjmp, that will leak the malloc.
**
**		Basically all code must be aware of "throws", and if one can
**		happen then there must be explicit handling of the cleanup.
**		This must be either at the point of the longjmp, or the moment
**		when the setjmp runs its "true" branch after a non-local jump:
**
**			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1376085/
**
**		(Note:  If you are integrating with C++ and a longjmp crosses
**		a constructed object, abandon all hope...UNLESS you use Ren/C++.
**		It is careful to avoid this trap, and you don't want to redo
**		that work.)
**
**		!!! v-- TRIAGE NOT YET INTEGRATED IN REN/C
**
**		In order to mitigate the inherent failure of trying to emulate
**		stack unwinding via longjmp, Rebol wraps the abstraction a bit.
**		If you had allocated any series and they were in "triage" at
**		the time the "throw" happened, then those will be automatically
**		freed (the garbage collector didn't know about them yet).

// "Under FreeBSD 5.2.1 and Mac OS X 10.3, setjmp and longjmp save and restore
// the signal mask. Linux 2.4.22 and Solaris 9, however, do not do this.
// FreeBSD and Mac OS X provide the functions _setjmp and _longjmp, which do
// not save and restore the signal mask."
//
// "To allow either form of behavior, POSIX.1 does not specify the effect of
// setjmp and longjmp on signal masks. Instead, two new functions, sigsetjmp
// and siglongjmp, are defined by POSIX.1. These two functions should always
// be used when branching from a signal handler."

// PUSH_TRAP is a construct which is used to catch errors that have been
// triggered by either the Do_Error() function directly, or the helper
// routines with names like TrapXXX().  (In Rebol user code, the trapping
// function is manually triggered with a DO of an ERROR! type.)  To call
// the push, you need a REBOL_STATE value to be passed which it will
// write into--which is a black box that clients shouldn't inspect.
//
// The routine also takes a pointer-to-a-REBVAL-pointer which represents
// an error.  Using the tricky mechanisms of setjmp/longjmp, there will
// be a first pass of execution where the line of code after the PUSH_TRAP
// will see the error pointer as being NULL.  If a trap occurs during
// code before the paired DROP_TRY happens, then the C state will be
// magically teleported back to the line after the PUSH_TRAP with the
// error value now non-null and inspectable for handling.
//
// Note: The implementation of this macro was chosen stylistically to
// hide the result of the setjmp call.  That's because you really can't
// put "setjmp" in arbitrary conditions like `setjmp(...) ? x : y`.  That's
// against the rules.  So although the preprocessor abuse below is a bit
// ugly, it helps establish that anyone modifying this code later not be
// able to avoid the truth of the limitation:

// PUSH_UNHALTABLE_TRAP is a form of PUSH_TRAP that will receive RE_HALT in

// it would usually be only at the topmost level (e.g. console REPL loop).
//
// It's also necessary at C-to-C++ boundary crossings (as in Ren/C++) even
// if they are not the topmost.  This is because C++ needs to know if *any*
// longjmp happens, to keep it from crossing stack frames with constructed
// objects without running their destructors.  Once it is done unwinding
// any relevant C++ call frames, it may have to trigger another longjmp IF
// the C++ code was called from other Rebol C code.  (This is done in the
// exception handler found in Ren/C++'s %function.hpp)
//
// Note: Despite the technical needs of low-level clients, there is likely
// no reasonable use-case for a user-exposed ability to intercept HALTs in
// Rebol code, for instance with a "TRY/HALTABLE" construction.
